    "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced plans to shut down government departments and institutions incurring significant losses to the national exchequer, aiming to reduce lavish expenses and promote austerity. He emphasized privatizing loss-making entities and fostering private sector investment. The government has taken steps to reduce inflation and interest rates, and is working on securing foreign investments and improving the business environment. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah acknowledged the province's failure to meet growth targets and blamed delays on the caretaker government. The Sindh budget focuses on completing old projects, with significant allocations for development. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is pushing for broader tax compliance, including enforcing credit card payments and imposing penalties on non-compliant businesses. The FBR also plans to suspend utilities for non-filers and impose travel bans. The federal budget has faced criticism for increasing the tax burden on taxpayers and failing to address non-paying sectors effectively.",
