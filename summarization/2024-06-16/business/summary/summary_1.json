    "summary": "The World Bank has approved a significant funding project aimed at improving education in Punjab, Pakistan. The \"Grades\" project focuses on enhancing learning outcomes, increasing school participation, and recovering learning losses due to COVID-19. It will benefit approximately 20 million children, headteachers, teachers, and mentors in both public and Punjab Education Foundation schools. The project includes measures to improve school management, expand participation, and enhance the quality of education through better teaching materials and learning environments. Additionally, it incorporates climate-resilient features and aims to rebuild schools damaged by floods, with a focus on inclusivity and accessibility. This initiative is part of a broader effort to strengthen public-private partnerships and prepare the next generation for climate shocks. The approval comes shortly after the World Bank sanctioned additional financing for the Dasu Hydropower Project to support Pakistan's energy sector.",
