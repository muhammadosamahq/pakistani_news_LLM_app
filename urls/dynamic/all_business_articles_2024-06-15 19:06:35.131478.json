        "text": "ISLAMABAD: At least 38 government departments exceeded the amounts allocated to them during the fiscal year 2023-24, receiving additional funds through supplementary and technical grants, details of current expenditure released by the Finance Division for the outgoing fiscal year show.\n\nApart from debt servicing (both local and foreign), the Power Division was the biggest spender, utilising Rs769.7 billion against an allocation of around Rs450.5bn. Consequently, it needed an additional sum of around Rs319.1bn to meet its expenses during FY2023-24.\n\nThe same was the case with the defence sector. Under the Defence Services head, the government had allocated Rs1.8tr, but expenditure ballooned to Rs1.835tr, posting an increase of Rs31.5bn due to overspending in almost all heads, such as \u201coperating expenses\u201d, \u201cphysical assets\u201d and \u201ccivil works\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Division required an injection of Rs20bn under the head of \u2018transfers\u2019 against its allocated budget of Rs6bn.\n\nSpending on Elections was a massive expense as well, given that FY24 was an election year. But against an allocation of Rs7.7bn, overall expenditure listed under this head was over Rs39bn, mainly due to the Feb 8 general elections and subsequent by-polls.\n\n38 govt departments \u2018overspent\u2019 a total of Rs454.1bn; three dozen divisions reported combined \u2018savings\u2019 of Rs446bn\n\nOn the other hand, the Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives required Rs13.9bn more than its yearly allocation of Rs8bn for the outgoing financial year. The increase was attributed to a rise in spending under the head of \u201cgrants, subsidies, and write-off loans\u201d.\n\nThe IT and Telecom Division also remained among big spenders, requiring Rs10bn more to meet expenses largely attributed to \u2018grants, subsidies, and write-off loans\u2019 head, from the government to meet its expenses against the allocation of Rs9bn.\n\nIn all, the total amount overspent by government departments amounted to around Rs454.1bn. This was just under the figure of Rs446bn, which is the total sum \u2018saved\u2019 by around three dozen departments and divisions, meaning that overall, the government overshot its expenses by around Rs8bn.\n\nThis means that these departments did not fully utilise the funds allotted to them, for any number of reasons. For example, the finance ministry saved Rs441bn under the \u201csubsidies and miscellaneous expenditure\u201d head.\n\nMoney saved this way is usually diverted to another needy head or ministry, which is facing a paucity of funds, through technical supplementary grants approved by the ECC or the cabinet, which are eventually okayed by parliament as supplementary demands for grants.\n\nMeanwhile, just over two dozen departments of the federal government remained within their means, i.e. utilised all of their budgetary allocations.\n\nThe finance ministry, as mentioned earlier, saved a substantial chunk of money against its allocation of a little over Rs1.5tr, while its expenses barely exceeded Rs1.1tr.\n\nThe Finance Division itself saved about Rs925m from its Rs4.2bn budget, owing to a reduction in operating expenses and physical assets.\n\nSimilarly, the premier social welfare programme, the Benazir Inc\u00ado\u00adme Support Programme could not utilise around Rs450bn of its Rs471bn allocation, as it managed to significantly reduce its expenses under the head of \u2018employee-related expenditures\u2019.\n\nIn the Establishment Division, Rs612m out of its Rs8.2bn budget remained unutilised as it reduced operating expenses, among other heads.\n\nMeanwhile, the Naya Pakistan Housing Authority, which was allocated Rs1bn, could only spend Rs536m, with an almost Rs450m \u2018saving\u2019. The judiciary also contributed to the savings regime, with the Supreme Court, Islamabad High Court and Islamabad district judiciary registering a combined saving of around Rs0.5bn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

        "text": "KARACHI: The Sindh government on Friday announced a development outlay of Rs959.1 billion, up by 30.5 per cent from the current year\u2019s Rs735bn.\n\nIn his budget speech, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said the Annual Development Programme (ADP) would not include any new schemes, as the focus would be on the completion of the projects that have been ongoing for the last 10 years.\n\nAccording to a breakdown of the development outlay, Rs493bn will go to the provincial ADP with Rs55bn to the district ADP. The government estimated that Rs334bn would be spent as foreign project assistance and Rs76.9bn for federal PSDP schemes.\n\nThe provincial ADP\u2019s estimates of Rs493bn are 29.7pc higher than Rs380bn of FY24, registering an increase of Rs113bn.\n\nNo new schemes announced for FY25\n\nThe estimated current revenue expenditure for FY25 is Rs1,912.4bn against Rs1,411bn of the previous year.\n\nAccording to the government, the increase is mainly due to the inflationary impact on operating expenses, enhancement of grants-in-aid to non-financial institutions, including hospitals, public sector universities, local councils, necessary salary raises in the shape of relief allowance to the government employees and a rise in pension expenditure.\n\nThe budget document said there are 4,250 ongoing schemes with an allocation of Rs305.49bn. There are 395 un-approved schemes which were part of ADP 2023-24, but could not be approved due to the ban imposed by the Election Commission of Pakistan; these schemes will remain un-approved in ADP 2024-25 with an allocation of Rs92.87bn.\n\nAccording to the budget papers, 552 ongoing schemes are those where over 70pc expenditures are made. Such schemes have been fully funded for completion by June 2025.\n\nA total of 849 ongoing schemes with a throw-forward of less than Rs50 million have also been fully funded for completion by June 2025. Also, 858 small-nature ongoing schemes have been fully funded for completion by June 2025.\n\nThose schemes, where tenders are not issued and if they require cost increase, will be provided additional funds from block allocation of Rs80bn kept in the ADP.\n\nWith this strategy, out of the total 4,644 schemes continuing in the ADP 2024-25, there will be about 1,812 schemes which have been provided full funds and are likely to be completed in FY 2024-25.\n\nThe provincial government allocated Rs32.163bn for schemes in the education sector for fiscal FY25 as compared to Rs13.82bn allocated in the current ADP.\n\nA significant jump was noted in the allocation for the transport and communication sector. The allocation for this sector in FY25 is Rs60.4bn against Rs2.2bn. The government is planning for more hybrid buses in Karachi and other major cities of the province.\n\nThe water and sanitation and road sector also got special attention from the government, as the allocations for these sectors also multiplied. These schemes in the local government got Rs71.959bn, while in FY24 the expenditure on these ADP schemes remained Rs15.7bn.\n\nWater and sanitation sector schemes in the Public Health Engineering Department will get an allocation of Rs22bn against Rs3.26bn of the previous fiscal year.\n\n\u201cA big chunk of funds would be used for construction of new roads and improving the conditions of the existing structure,\u201d said the budget paper.\n\nLike other sectors, the government significantly increased the allocation for the health sector schemes to Rs18bn as compared to Rs2.72bn in FY24.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) alleged on Friday that the incumbent government was causing irreversible damage to the country, citing the recently announced budget as evidence.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad. He was flanked by PTI leader Raoof Hasan.\n\nAyub claimed that complete budget documents were not presented in the National Assembly and that the budget had a seven per cent deficit, the highest in Pakistan\u2019s history. He also alleged that facilities provided to PML-N leaders and others in jail far exceeded those provided to Imran Khan.\n\nHe said on the one hand people were being arrested and imprisoned on nominal or frivolous charges, while on the other hand individuals facing serious allegations of embezzlement were being released.\n\nAyub shared his personal experience of being barred from entering a court in Sargodha, despite identifying himself as a member of the National Assembly. He said he told \u201cthem\u201d that being part of the parliament, the MNAs were the state, rather than those who wanted to stop the lawmakers.\n\nProtesters seeking Imran\u2019s release held from outside press club\n\nHe told the media that those granted bail by the court were re-arrested. He said the anti-terrorism court judge in Sargodha wrote to the Lahore High Court chief justice about the alleged pressure and harassment tactics being used to prevent him from holding hearings.\n\nAyub lamented that Pakistan\u2019s courts were not free, resulting in a lack of investment in the country despite the establishment of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC).\n\nHe also questioned the effectiveness of SIFC in attracting foreign investors, given the limited technical expertise available.\n\nReferring to the alleged disparity in treatment, he said Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif received daily visits from 60 to 70 people while in jail, whereas Imran was only allowed a 20-minute meeting with his lawyers and a monthly phone call with his children.\n\nAyub demanded that the PTI founding chairman be treated with the dignity afforded to a former prime minister and that his wife, Bushra Bibi, receive her rightful entitlements. He expressed hope for the ex-premier\u2019s immediate release.\n\nProtesters rounded up\n\nMeanwhile, a number of PTI workers and leaders at a protest demonstration outside the National Press Club, demanding Imran\u2019s release from jail, were picked up.\n\nPolice officers told Dawn that some 50 to 60 protesters, including PTI leader Amir Mughal, gathered outside the press club before police cordoned off the area. About a dozen of them, including Mr Mughal, were picked up and taken to a police station for further action while the rest managed to escape.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of the Islamabad Capital Police, when contacted, claimed ignorance about the incident. While he said he would respond after getting relevant information, he did not provide it till the filing of this report in the late hours of Friday.\n\nMunawer Azeem also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

This would yield about Rs3.763tr in revenue to 10 Discos in 2024-25 against Rs3.28tr this year.\n\nAfter the addition of 18pc general sales tax, the average base tariff for next year would jump to Rs42 per unit excluding other taxes, duties and surcharges and put an additional burden of about Rs580bn on Discos\u2019 consumers. This figure does not account for the impact on K-Electric, although Discos\u2019 tariff also applies to Karachi, nor does it include any adjustments related to monthly fuel and quarterly tariff adjustments.\n\nAs such, the average national tariff is expected to be much higher for consumers than the industrial sector, for which the prime minister on Friday announced a Rs10.69 per unit cut, with a negative revenue impact of Rs200bn. This amount would now stand transferred to domestic, commercial, bulk power consumers, etc.\n\nUnder the procedure, the power division, after the approval of the federal cabinet, would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs before a formal notification with effect from July 1, as already committed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nIn a series of a determinations released on Friday, Nepra not only worked the revenue requirements of all the distribution companies separately for the next year, but it also calculated the average power purchase price on a countrywide basis.\n\nAccording to Nepra, the power purchase price (PPP), which accounts for almost 90pc of power tariff, for Discos in 2024-25 (after excluding the share of K-Electric) \u201cworks out as Rs3,277.506 billion, which includes Rs1,161.257bn for fuel and variable O&M (operation and maintenance) costs and Rs2,116.25bn as capacity charges\u201d, including the use of service charges, market operator fee, etc.\n\n\u201cThus, the capacity charges work out as around 65pc of the total projected PPP of XWDISCOs, whereas energy cost is around 35pc of the total projected PPP,\u201d Nepra said.\n\nIn terms of the average per-unit power purchase price of Discos on a unit-purchased basis \u2014 i.e. before the adjustment of allowed T&D (transmission and despatch) losses of Discos \u2014 capacity charges work out as Rs17.66 per unit, whereas energy charges are Rs9.69 per unit, totalling Rs27.35 per unit for 2024-25, Nepra said. The national average power purchase price works out at Rs27 per unit.\n\nAfter adding losses and distribution margins, the average tariff goes up to Rs35.50 per unit. The increase was necessitated mainly because of the rupee\u2019s devaluation, high inflation, exorbitant interest rates, addition of new capacities and overall low sales growth, the regulator said.\n\nReal applicable average tariff\n\nAn official said the real applicable average national tariff would now stand between Rs65 and 72 per unit after inclusion of surcharges, taxes, duties and levies besides monthly and quarterly adjustments.\n\nThis was one of the key requirements of the upcoming bailout of the IMF to ensure further progress on structural reforms, particularly with regard to the energy sector\u2019s viability and governance of state-owned enterprises.\n\nLast year, too, the government enhanced the national uniform electricity tariff by an average of Rs5 per unit, involving an additional financial impact of Rs477bn and Rs7.91 per unit in 2022-23 with Rs893bn impact on consumers. No wonder then the electricity consumption dropped by 7-13pc.\n\nAlthough K-Electric was not part of the tariff-setting exercise for Discos, the same rate would ultimately apply to its consumers owing to a uniform base rate applicable across the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

The federal government, in its budget announced earlier this week, expects the provinces to deliver a surplus of Rs1.217tr in the coming fiscal year.\n\nMost of Sindh\u2019s revenues, or 62pc, is expected to come from federal transfers, followed by 22pc from provincial receipts.\n\nThe remaining revenue will come from current capital receipts of Rs21.6bn, foreign project assistance of Rs334bn, federal gra\u00adnts in the form of PSDP of Rs77bn, foreign grants of Rs6bn, and a carryover cash balance of Rs55bn.\n\nShah also announced a proposal to raise the minimum wage from Rs35,500 to Rs37,000 and increase salaries by up to 30pc and pensions by 15pc.\n\n\u201cThe government of Sindh has proposed a hefty 30pc increase in the salary of employees of grades 1 to 6,\u201d the chief minister said.\n\nHe also introduced a personal allowance for these employees to align their monthly salary with the minimum wage of Rs37,000. For employees in grades 7 to 16, a 25pc increase was proposed, and for grades 17 and above, a 22pc increase.\n\n\u201cWe have also proposed a 15pc increase in the pension of retired employees,\u201d he added.\n\nRevenue receipts\n\nThe total receipts are divided into five categories: current revenue receipts of Rs2.56tr, current capital receipts of Rs21.62bn, other receipts of Rs416.92bn, and carryover cash balance of Rs55bn.\n\nThe current revenue receipts include Rs1.9tr of federal transfers in the form of revenue assignment (Rs1.75 trillion), straight transfers (Rs106.415bn) and grants of Rs46.98bn to offset losses due to the abolished octroi and zila tax.\n\nThe current revenue receipts also include Rs268.9bn provincial tax receipts, Rs350bn provincial sales tax on services, and Rs42.9bn provincial non-tax receipts.\n\nAs for the current capital receipts, Rs6.7bn goes to local repayments and loans and Rs14.9bn to bank borrowing. The \u201cother receipts\u201d head eyes foreign project assistance (FPA) of Rs334bn, \u201cother federal grants\u201d of Rs76.9bn and foreign grants of Rs5.9bn.\n\nExpenditures\n\nThe estimated total expenditure includes a current revenue expenditure of Rs1.91tr, current capital exp\u00adenditure of Rs184.8bn and development expenditure of Rs959bn.\n\nThe development expenditure includes the provincial annual deve\u00adlo\u00adpment plan (ADP) of Rs493bn, foreign project assistance of Rs334bn, other federal grants of Rs76.9bn and district ADP of Rs55bn.\n\nThe CM said the education sector\u2019s budgetary provision has been proposed to be Rs454bn against last year\u2019s budget of Rs334bn.\n\nHe said the provision of funds for the Sindh Higher Education Commission is Rs34.5bn against last year\u2019s budget of Rs23bn, an increase of around 50pc.\n\nCM Shah also announced a 32pc increase in the health sector\u2019s budget to Rs300bn against Rs227.8bn last year, claiming that the Sindh government \u201ctakes pride in having the best tertiary healthcare system in the country\u201d.\n\nHe said the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), National Institute of Child Health (NICH), and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) combined now have 4,000 beds.\n\nFor transport and commutation, the Sindh government has allocated Rs7.62bn for the next fiscal year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has expressed apprehensions over \u201cexcessive powers\u201d granted to the tax body, claiming that the government\u2019s decision would stifle business activities.\n\nFPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said on Friday that instead of further empowering the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the government should address issues of the public and business community\u2019s lack of faith in the apex tax body.\n\nWhile addressing a post-budget news conference, Sheikh said the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 was \u201cnot business friendly\u201d and all new measures will only \u201cdiscourage exports and local business activities\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe cannot move in circles. The government is giving too much power to FBR [\u2026] it can even take help from intelligence agencies to arrest businessperson considered defaulters by FBR,\u201d the FPCCI president claimed, adding that even bail was not granted to the accused booked by the tax body.\n\n\u201cThese measures will discourage investments [\u2026] that is why we see no foreign player entering Pakistani markets despite several MoUs with many countries.\u201d\n\nSheikh said the FPCCI always offered help to the government in broadening the tax base and increasing revenue generation from other sources \u201cbut no response was received from authorities\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstead, the decision has always been to increase tax rates and empower the FBR.\u201d\n\nAhmed Chinoy said empowering FBR and other authorities \u201chas always opened new avenues of corruption\u201d. These government departments \u201cblackmail\u201d businesses and compel them to pay less taxes in exchange for \u201csome deals\u201d with officials.\n\n\u201cGovernment has not focused on reforms in FBR through digitisation and reduced discretionary powers of its officers,\u201d Chinoy added.\n\nOther FPCCI office-bearers said the revenue collection target had been increased by 38 per cent without any direction. Instead, the salaried class has been burdened with more taxes.\n\nAhmed Waheed, the FPCCI tax committee coordinator, said the issue is that the government is only targeting those who are already taxed heavily.\n\nHe said the salaries of government employees have been raised in the budget, but it was not possible for every private sector employer to do the same under existing economic conditions. The result will be shrinking fiscal space for private sector employees, he added.\n\nMian Zahid Hussain said the government\u2019s expenses have been increased even though its productivity has always remained questionable.\n\nNo target has been set to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and even those departments which have been shut down will remain under the government\u2019s domain, he added.\n\nThe speakers said punitive measures against non-filers, such as travel bans, more duties on petrol and diesel and essential commodities like food and mobile phones, will only lead to the flight of capital and human resources from the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2024",

        "text": "The government on Friday slashed the prices of petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) for the next fortnight by Rs10.2 and Rs2.33, respectively.\n\nIn a notification, the finance ministry said the prices of petroleum products had seen a mixed trend in the international market in the last fortnight. It said Ogra had worked out the consumer prices based on the international market price variations.\n\nIt said the new petrol price was Rs258.16 per litre and that of HSD was Rs267.89.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office termed the reduction a gift from the premier on account of the upcoming Eidul Azha holiday.\n\nEarlier, sources had said that the government was expected to pass on the impact of lower international prices to consumers. The prices of petrol and HSD had declined in the international market by about $3.75 and $2.7 per barrel, respectively, in the last two weeks.\n\nThis was on top of about $12 and $8 per barrel drop in the price of petrol and HSD, respectively, in the previous two fortnights.\n\nThe price of petrol had gone down to slightly over $90 per barrel from about $94 per barrel while the HSD price was reduced to $95 from $98 per barrel.\n\nThe import premium on petrol has slightly decreased in the last fortnight to $9.5 per barrel from $9.7. On the other hand, the value of the rupee has also remained stable.\n\nMoreover, the final price also includes the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL), for which the government has already achieved the maximum permissible limit of Rs60 per litre under the law on both petrol and HSD.\n\nThis has contributed Rs720 billion to the government kitty in the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 31.\n\nThe government had set a budget target to collect Rs869bn in PDL during the current fiscal year under the commitments made with the International Monetary Fund, which has now been revised to Rs960bn.\n\nAt present, the government is charging about Rs80 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, including about Rs19-20 per litre customs duty.\n\nThis was despite the fact that the general sales tax is zero on all petroleum products.\n\nPetrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene.\n\nPetroleum and electricity prices have been the key drivers of the high rate of inflation. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of the middle- and lower-middle class.\n\nAdditional reporting by Abdullah Momand.",

        "text": "Global rating agency Moody\u2019s on Friday said that the country\u2019s weak debt affordability drives high debt sustainability risks as it noted that the government spends more than half its revenue on interest payments.\n\nIn a comment regarding the newly finance bill for the fiscal year (FY) 2025, it said, \u201cThe budget estimated debt servicing payments to have increased by about 18pc for fiscal 2025 compared with a year ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government spends more than half its revenue on interest payments, indicating very weak debt affordability which drives high debt sustainability risks\u201d it said, adding that \u201cabout 55pc of fiscal year 2025 revenue (Rs9.8 trillion) is earmarked for interest payments on the government\u2019s debt\u201d.\n\nRegarding the increase in expenditure, the rating agency said it reflected \u201clack of significant cost-containment measures and Pakistan\u2019s very high interest payments\u201d.\n\nIt was quick to note that the subsidies increased by 27pc to Rs1.4 trillion, \u201cmainly driven by large increases in subsidies to the power sector\u201d which reflected litte progress in energy sector reforms.\n\nOverall, the rating agency said that budget reflected \u201cquicker fiscal consolidation, but ability to sustain reforms will be key to easing liquidity risks\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the agency echoed the same sentiments as experts as it highlighted that the finance bill \u201cwill likely support Pakistan\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the IMF for a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme that will be crucial for the government to unlock financing from IMF and other bilateral and multilateral partners to meet its external financing needs\u201d.\n\nHowever, it cautioned that the government\u2019s ability to \u201csustain reform implementation\u201d will be key to meeting the budget targets and unlocking external financing, which is necessary for easing of liquidity risks.\n\nIt highlighted that \u201ca resurgence of social tensions on the back of high cost of living \u2014 which may increase because of higher taxes and future adjustments to energy tariffs \u2014 could weigh on reform implementation.\n\n\u201cMoreover, risks that the coalition government may not have a sufficiently strong electoral mandate to continually implement difficult reforms remain,\u201d it commented.\n\nIn the budget, the government had announced a consolidated budget deficit of 5.9 per cent of the GDP for the fiscal year 2025 \u2014 from the previous year\u2019s estimated 7.4pc \u2014 with the primary balance set at a surplus of 2pc of GDP for the upcoming year, the report recounted.\n\nAdditionally, the government has projected real GDP growth at 3.6pc and headline inflation at 12pc. It also sought to increase federal government revenue to an ambitious Rs17.8trillion \u2014 46pc higher than previous year\u2019s \u2014 through a \u201ccombination of new taxes and stronger nominal growth\u201d.\n\nAccording to the comment, this showed that \u201cthe government seeks to achieve quicker fiscal consolidation mainly through increases in revenue, with little spending-containment measures\u201d.\n\nGlobal prospects report\n\nThe World Bank in its \u2018Global economic prospects\u2019 report said that Pakistan\u2019s growth was expected to pick up at 2.3pc in FY25, where else \u201cindustrial activity and confidence are projected to improve mainly due to easing import restrictions and moderating inflation, although they remain constrained largely as a result of tight macroeconomic policies\u201d.\n\nThe report said that the growth is assumed under \u201ccontinued sound macroeconomic management, progress with structural reform implementation, and continued multilateral inflows and bilateral rollovers, which would boost investor confidence\u201d.\n\nRegarding inflation, the report noted that inflation had \u201cmoderated over the past year due to high base effects coupled with the stabilisation of the exchange rate, but it remains high\u201d.\n\nOn a more positive note, it said that \u201cforeign exchange reserves have increased in several countries, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, reflecting the easing of currency pressures and receipts of official flows\u201d.",

        "text": "FINANCE MINISTER Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday expressed his \u2018resolve\u2019 to increase Pakistan\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio to 13pc in the next three years. Addressing a post-budget media briefing, he said: \u201cOur basic principle while framing this budget was to expand the tax base.\u201d\n\nGiven this statement and his earlier declaration at the launch of the Economic Survey that \u201ccountries cannot be run on charity but taxes\u201d, it was expected that the new budget would have significant measures to broaden the tax base. The reality of the taxation measures announced by him in the budget, however, does not match his rhetoric.\n\nBefore we delve into the reasons for this gap, it should be acknowledged that the budget does propose the revocation of certain tax exemptions being enjoyed by certain privileged sectors of the economy. That, though, has been done to raise the annual tax collection to Rs12b.97tr, a sine qua non to qualify for the three-year Extended Fund Facility being sought from the IMF.\n\nOne does not have to be a financial wizard to see that the budget still follows the same tried, tested, flopped and, therefore, oft-rejected trope of milking those already in the tax net even more. A large part of the additional revenue measures being proposed target the same two segments \u2014 the salaried classes and documented businesses \u2014 which already pay the bulk of personal and direct taxes.\n\nAt best, the government can only hope that its proposal to levy higher taxes on non-filers trying to buy or sell property will force them to join the tax net voluntarily. At worst, it will force more people to engage in cash transactions and, thus, increase tax evasion.\n\nThe next budget, in fact, reflects the ruling PML-N\u2019s political concerns more than its economic reform agenda. For one, it has left its traditional support \u2014 traders \u2014 virtually untouched. Nothing except such political imperatives explain why the finance minister did not levy any direct taxes on retail trade even when the government has talked a lot about it of late.\n\nSimilarly, while there is a proposal to levy federal excise duty on property, real estate developers and agents have been shielded from any additional tax burden. This, too, stems from political expediency: the PML-N cannot afford to anger the middle class other than those sections that have already turned against it.\n\nThe budget, therefore, lacks both imagination and courage. It shows that the finance team did not envision any structural changes to broaden the tax-to-GDP ratio and, instead, chose to stick to old formulae. It also shows that the ruling party is scared of taking bold steps lest it loses whatever little public support and legitimacy it has. Consequently, the budget it has presented signifies nothing but a lost opportunity to fix the system.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2024",

GRADES will help the government of Punjab substantially reduce this number and, in parallel, improve foundational learning outcomes for boys and girls who are already in school,\u201d said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThis will be done through scaling up and strengthening public-private partnerships, improving school preparedness among young children, enhancing the quality and use of teaching and learning materials and assessments, and improving the learning environment in schools,\u201d the WB country director further said.\n\nGiven Pakistan\u2019s vulnerability to climate shocks, the project will follow a climate-resilient approach with measures to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, including the construction of approximately 5,400 additional climate-smart classrooms in primary schools, the IFI said.\n\nAccording to the WB statement, the project will introduce low-cost climate-smart features such as raised plinths and reflective roofs.\n\n\"The project will prioritise reconstruction of schools damaged during the 2022 floods, especially girls' schools, overcrowded schools and schools in locations with high numbers of out-of-school children.\"\n\nIn addition, the IFI said that measures to strengthen disability inclusion, such as making school infrastructure more accessible and integrating inclusive education principles in teacher coaching were also part of the project's inclusive design.\n\n\"The World Bank and the government of Punjab have a strong history of collaboration on education reform,\u201d said Izza Farrakh, Task Team Leader for the Project.\n\n\"GRADES will leverage this partnership for further innovation, such as climate-resilient classrooms and integrating climate change education into the curriculum.\n\n\u201cReforms such as these will help ensure a safe and conducive learning environment and at the same time prepare the next generation to be more resilient to climate shocks and natural disasters,\" Farrukh said.\n\nThis $150 million approval for the GRADES project comes days after the World Bank approved $1 billion in a second round of additional financing for the Dasu Hydropower Stage I (DHP I) Project.\n\nThis financing is aimed at supporting the expansion of hydropower electricity supply, improving access to socio-economic services for local communities, and building the Water and Power Development Authority\u2019s (WAPDA) capacity to prepare future hydropower projects.\n\n\u201cPakistan\u2019s energy sector suffers from multiple challenges to achieving affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy,\u201d said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.\n\n\u201cThe Dasu Hydropower Project site is one of the best hydropower sites in the world and is a game changer for the Pakistan energy sector.

        "text": "Country sets challenging tax revenue target of Rs13tr for FY25.\n\nGovt seeks to avert debt default for slowest growing economy in region.\n\nAnalyst believes budget in its current form should be acceptable to IMF.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan's plan to raise taxes in its 2024-25 budget and boost state revenues will help it win approval from the International Monetary Fund for a loan to stave off another economic meltdown, but could fuel public anger, a former finance official, experts and industrialists said.\n\nThe country has set a challenging tax revenue target of Rs13 trillion ($47 billion) for the year starting July 1, a near-40% jump from the current year, and a sharp drop in its fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP from 7.4% for the current year.\n\nThe federal government had to reduce the fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6-8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\n\"The budget is enough to get an IMF programme, as long as ... the budget is passed in the way it is presented,\" former finance minister Miftah Ismail said. But, he added, the revenue targets would be challenging, as would the growth target of 3.6%.\n\n\"The two cannot happen simultaneously,\" said Miftah, who as then-finance minister successfully negotiated the revival of last Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme in 2022.\n\nOutside analysts largely concur. Emerging Market Watch's Metodi Tzanov believes the budget in its current form should be acceptable to the IMF.\n\n\"The government ticked almost all the right boxes to comply with IMF conditions, including withdrawal of tax exemptions, raising corporate tax for exporters, increasing the personal income tax rate, tightening the noose around non-filers, and hiking fuel tax,\" he said.\n\nBut some said the IMF might baulk if it saw the tax target as unrealistic.\n\nFinance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who presented the budget for the first time, said he expected to seal a Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF in July.\n\nThe Washington-based lander did not immediately publicly comment on the budget and did not respond to questions sent by Reuters.\n\nThe big rise in the tax target is made up of a 48% increase in direct taxes and 35% hike in indirect taxes. Non-tax revenue, including petroleum levies, is seen increasing by a whopping 64%.\n\nTaxes have notably been slapped on previously protected export-oriented sectors such as textiles, which consistently make up over half of Pakistan's exports, and whose receipts keep a persistently high external account deficit in check.\n\nThe representative body for the sector, All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, called for a review of the budget, terming it \"extremely regressive\" and one that \"threatens the collapse of the textile sector and its exports\".\n\nIt warned of \"dire consequences for employment and external sector stability, as well as for overall economic and political stability and security\".\n\nThe Pakistan Business Council also called for budgetary measures to be reconsidered.\n\n\"The budget prioritises securing another IMF EFF but lacks innovation for domestic economic growth,\" said Musadaq Zulqarnain, director at the Pakistan Textile Council and chairman of Interloop, one of the country's largest textile manufacturers.\n\nThe coalition government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif does not have the luxury of a parliamentary majority to help it pass the budget smoothly.\n\nSticking to the reform measures will require it to resist pushback from key economic sectors as well as a broader public already angry at the prospect of further price rises.\n\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz's (PML-N) party had to convince its largest ally, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), without whom it does not have a majority, to attend the budget session in parliamentary. PPP said it was not happy with some of the measures.\n\nBut analyst Yousaf Nazar, formerly of Citibank, believes the protestations are just political posturing. \"[PPP] won\u2019t rock the boat,\" he said.\n\nWith few options in the short term to support the country's recent stability, an IMF programme appears crucial.\n\nIncreasing the tax base in an economy where proper documentation is often lacking will require considerable time and effort. Pakistan's undocumented parallel economy is huge and 44% of its nominal GDP does not contribute significantly towards direct tax revenue, according to the Tola Associates, a tax firm.\n\nTraders and agriculturalists in particular, both politically influential, have resisted the government's push to register themselves and document their sales.\n\n\"If the tax base is not going to increase, moving forward, the country\u2019s tax revenues growth can drop further and it might end up as a dead weight loss to the economy,\" Tola Associates said in a note.\n\n\"The real challenge is that of implementation,\" said former central bank chief and Managing Director at Alvarez & Marsal Reza Baqir.\n\n\"For example, the budget targets an ambitious increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio. Many previous budgets have similarly targeted ambitious improvements. I would hope that the lessons from why those ambitions were not realised have been reflected in this budget.\"",
