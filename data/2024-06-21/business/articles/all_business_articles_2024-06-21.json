        "text": "Bulls continued their stampede post-Eid as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed more than 2,000 points to reach an all-time high, which analysts attributed to the \u201cdovish outlook\u201d of rating agencies for the country.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index gained 1738.81, or 2.27 per cent to stand at 78,445.58 \u2014 an all-time high \u2014 from the previous close of 76,706.77 points at 1:30pm. Finally, the index closed at 78,801.53, up by 2094.76 or 2.73pc from the previous close.\n\nMohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the bullish momentum to \u201cpositive sentiments continue amid hope that new budget will help [in] securing [a] long-term IMF deal\u201d.\n\nRaza Jafri, chief executive of EFG Hermes Pakistan, said, \u201cThe market is pricing in the favourable news over the Eid holidays, including Fitch\u2019s dovish view on inflation outlook and the proposed reduction in electricity tariffs for industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bout of modest foreign selling pressure this month, possibly due to FTSE rebalancing, also appears to be largely behind us,\u201d he added.\n\nYousuf M Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, highlighted the upward trajectory was due to \u201c\u2019declining fixed income yields, no additional capital gains and dividend taxes in the budget, rationalisation of energy tariffs, improving economic sentiment and reduced uncertainty over the balance of payments situation\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, Farooq highlighted that \u201ccomments from Fitch and Moody\u2019s have all contributed to today\u2019s market rally\u201d.\n\nAwais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, echoed similar sentiments.\n\nHe said, \u201cPositive statements from global credit rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Fitch about Pakistan\u2019s budget and economic outlook bolster investor confidence in the government\u2019s strategy to address fiscal and external imbalances.\u201d\n\nShahab Farooq, director of research at Next Capital Limited, noted that the index had crossed the 78,000 level \u201camid positive comment by the two leading rating agencies\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, he attributed the climb to factors such as the \u201cstrong possibility of signing of SLA with the IMF for a new larger and longer programme, inflation expected to remain low at around 12pc for June, rethinking by the government on some tax measures announced in the budget and institutional buying\u201d.",

The budget for the upcoming year aims for a modest 3.6 per cent GDP growth, and sets an ambitious Rs13tr tax collection target, raising taxes on salaried classes and removing tax exemptions for the rest.\n\nDebate on the budget formally opened today in the NA after the Eidul Azha holidays with its passage planned for June 24. Ayub opened the debate with vociferous criticism of the budget.\n\nHis speech was muted several times as he lamented the alleged interference of the establishment.\n\n\u201cThis budget is the story that began with vote ko izzat do (respect the vote) and ended with boot ko izzat do (respect the boot),\u201d Ayub said while criticising the government.\n\n\u201cThe budget is a fraud with the people. This is a highway robbery against the people of Pakistan. This budget in actuality is economic terrorism against the people and the future of the country,\u201d he added.\n\nAyub alleged that the budget was made with the help of \u201ceconomic hitmen who want to shake the foundation of this country\u201d.\n\nHe further claimed that these same \u201ceconomic hitmen\u201d were also involved in the PTI\u2019s ouster from power in April 2022.\n\nAyub said investors would not trust the economy to invest in a country where there was \u201cno rule of law\u201d, adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had clearly instructed the government to talk to other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe finance minister is a very professional man but his wings were clipped,\u201d Ayub said, alleging that the government was trying to undermine Aurangzeb such as removing him from the chairmanship of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec).\n\n\u201cAurangzeb sahib\u2019s heart must have sunk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Ecnec chairmanship was taken away by the prime minister and his wingman [\u2026] entered and his name is Senator Ishaq Dar. Family concern, family business, private limited,\u201d Ayub added.\n\n\u201cAurangzeb is smiling right now but he must be thinking that I will talk to Omar Ayub later because I have said the right things.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at the people who Aurangzeb is associated with, if you look at their biography, each one of them is a known gangster,\u201d he said.\n\nThe word gangster was expunged by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.\n\nThe opposition leader also questioned whether the members of the PPP owned the budget.\n\n\u201cWould you vote for it with the government or not,\u201d he said, adding that only a few people from the PPP participated in the budget presentation.\n\n\u201cAnd if they are not with them then the government would be slaughtered. They do not have it in them to run the government,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe budget won\u2019t be passed. An illegal, anti-people budget cannot work.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the federal government had failed to impose taxes on the elite it promised in the previous budget.\n\n\u201cThe biggest element of tax is income tax where they underperformed. They are unable to put weight on the elite,\u201d he said.\n\nAyub added that everyone was saying the budget was \u201ca constrained budget under the long shadow of IMF stipulations,\u201d adding that the government did not put any room to manoeuvre for itself.\n\n\u201cThey dug a grave for themselves, laid in it by themselves and are now asking to be saved,\u201d he said, adding that only PTI founder Imran Khan could save the economy.\n\nHe said the nation stood behind the former premier and would go through hard times for him, however, the same could not be said for the current government.",

He said in the last one year, the market had gained over 95% in rupee terms, and 100% in dollar terms.\n\nSaad Ali, Intermarket Securities Director of Research, told Geo.tv that renewed optimism for another IMF deal following a budget that was in agreement with the financial institution's recommendations and hike in base power tariff before the Eid holidays fueled the rally.\n\n\"Fitch Ratings thinks that the Budget is good enough for an IMF programme. Also, [the] market [is] taking positively PM's plan to reduce power tariff for industries,\" Ali added.\n\nThe federal government has set a challenging tax revenue target of Rs13 trillion for FY25, a near-40% jump from the current year, and a sharp drop in its fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP from 7.4% for the current year.\n\nPakistan had to reduce its fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6-8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nIn a statement a day earlier, Fitch Ratings said Pakistan's ambitious FY25 budget strengthens prospects for an IMF deal. \"We believe a new IMF deal will be agreed, underpinning other external funding.\"\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL) Head of Research Tahir Abbas also said that there had been no major changes in the budget for the stock market, while the budgetary framework was in line with the IMF recommendations and expectations of signing a new and bigger programme [were high].\n\nAlso, he added, a downward inflation trajectory and the likelihood of a further rate cut were keeping the market sentiment positive.\n\nSamiullah Tariq, the head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Company, said the market was bullish as there were expectations of major inflows from retail investors.\n\n\"In my view, market is increasing as there is anticipation of major inflow from retail investors in the market as alternate investment avenues like real estate have been heavily taxed on the budget,\" he said.",

In reaction to this, the politician said he knows who is taxing vehicles.\n\nThe committee, however, adjourned the matter in the meeting.\n\nThe politician, who is a member of the Senate in an independent capacity, objected to the tax proposals made in the budget, announced last week by the federal government.\n\nThe government has, as per analysts, devised the budget in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Islamabad hopes to sign a new and bigger programme with the global lending institution.\n\nThe federal government had to increase taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6 billion to $8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, Vawda also lamented the imposition of taxes on property in the recently proposed budget, insisting that the market across the country has become stagnant.\n\n\"Now, a common man will not be able to buy a house,\" said the senator, sharing his viewpoint during the meeting.\n\nResponding to Vawda in the meeting, the FBR chairman said tax rates in the property sector are \"fair\".\n\n\"In the property sector, tax is 15% for filers and 45% for non-filers,\" said the FBR chairman. He also highlighted that the salaried class is taxed up to 35% and non-salaried up to 45%.\n\n\"How will the common man build a house with an increased tax on property,\" said Vawda in response to the official's comment.\n\nThe FBR chairman maintained that a Re1 per kilograms increase in Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cement has been proposed by FBR, as the board has not benefitted from the increased rates of the commodity.\n\n\"Re1 is being raised so that FBR gets revenue,\" said the chairman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the FBR chairman was also questioned about the FED imposed on plots.\n\n\"How excise duty is imposed on plots?\" asked PPP senator Farooq H Naek.\n\n\"We wanted to impose sales tax,\" said the FBR chairman, who was then told by Naek that plots, in fact, neither come under the category of commodities nor services.\n\n\"Under which law did you tax the purchase of a plot? You have stretched the law and included them,\" the senator said, contesting that this law will be challenged and he doesn't favour it.\n\nThe standing committee, during the meeting, took up the matter of the FED increase on cigarettes.\n\n\"Has increasing FED on cigarettes reduced cigarette consumption?\" asked Senator Naek.\n\nResponding to the senator, the FBR chair said: \"Formal sector output has declined by 40%. But people did not stop smoking, despite increasing taxes.\"\n\nHe added that the board, this year, seized 400 million \"non-tax paid cigarette sticks\".\n\n\"If smuggled cigarettes are found in a shop, such shop will be sealed,\" he maintained.\n\nPPP Senator Sherry Rehman said: \"If you can close all the shops big and small then it is allowed.\"\n\nSenator Naek pointed out that the price of the items sold in any shop is not mentioned. He said there is no enforcement of the relevant law, terming it a violation.\n\n\"Ensure all items are priced prominently,\" said Naek, addressing FBR officials, after which the proposal was approved by the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the committee also brought amendments to the Public Finance Management Act, 2019 under consideration.\n\n\"Under the amendments, the definition of technical supplementary grant is being expanded,\" said a representative of the finance ministry.\n\nNaek asked why there was a need for the amendment, while Senator Rehman said that the Ministry of Finance is seeking the authority to use the money that cannot be used.\n\n\"The language of this law is not rightly used and should be improved first,\" said Naek, adding that the statutory amendment cannot, otherwise, be passed.\n\n\"Parliamentary approval should be sought before issuing supplementary grants,\" said committee's chairman Mandviwala.",

This will include a challenging tax target of a near-40% jump from the current year, and a sharp drop in the fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP from 7.4% for the current year.\n\nSheikh said the strict budgetary measures to secure new IMF funding will be likely to attract more foreign investors to the market, in addition to the current inflows.\n\nPakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament is set to meet later on Thursday to debate the budget that the government presented last week.",

The meeting was attended by Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Mukadam, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudasser Tippu, Iranian Consul General in Lahore Mehran Movahhedfar and other dignitaries.\n\nAt the outset of the meeting, Regional Chairman and Vice President of FPCCI Zaki Aijaz expressed deep sorrow over the passing of Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi.\n\nHe said that we need to work together to achieve the $10 billion trade target. Zaki Aijaz suggested establishing a trade group comprising traders from both countries to identify potential areas of trade and make joint recommendations.\n\nEmphasis was also laid on the need to operationalize the barter trade mechanism. To promote trade relations, stress was laid on exchanging trade and cultural delegations, direct flights between the two countries, business-to-business meetings, promoting cultural and student exchange programs, and monitoring the performance of trade groups.\n\nMuhammad Mudasser Tippu, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran, said that a decision has been made to keep the border between the two countries open for 24 hours to achieve the $10 billion trade target. He further said that negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA) are underway and that the Ministry of Commerce and FBR should be contacted in this regard. He requested the Iranian ambassador to reduce trade duties on various items.\n\nIranian Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Mukadam said that there are vast opportunities for bilateral trade between Pakistan and Iran. He stated that during the recent visit of the Iranian President and his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, it was decided that a trade delegation comprising all sectors would visit Iran.\n\nHe said that due to the lack of a better trade system and banking channels, the Iranian embassy will provide full cooperation to resolve currency issues. He informed that Iran has allowed Pakistani trucks to move freely, but Pakistan has not yet granted permission to Iranian trucks.

The Collectorate accepted the classification of the goods and allowed clearance by granting the said benefit.\n\nHowever, the department issued show-cause notice after the lapse of two years, saying that the benefit of zero-rating was not available against the import. Therefore, the importer was liable to pay all the recoverable duty and taxes besides a penalty for misdeclaration.\n\nThe importer challenged the notice, saying that the consignments were examined in both the cases and examination report was reduced by the examination staff. He further pointed out that on the basis of the examination report, the assessment was made and the goods declarations were gate out as per law.\n\nHe maintained that the recovery cannot be enforced on the presumptions basis. Further, he contested his case on the point that the department has no jurisdiction to recover or adjudicate any short levied (i.e. recovery of sales tax and income tax) once the imported consignments are released/cleared from Customs. He said it is a settled principal that the Clearance Collectorate as well as Adjudication Collectorate have no jurisdiction to adjudicate/ recover sales tax at post release stage.\n\nThe department, on the other hand, stressed that the importer had misdeclared the goods to avail undue benefit of exemption from sales tax to defraud the government from its legitimate revenue. It further said that the Customs Act provides that in case by reason of any such document or statement or by any collusion, any duty or charge has not been levied or short levied or has erroneously funded, a show-cause notice can be served within five years of the relevant date. The relevant forum disagreed with the department and set aside the notice.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

The authorities have proposed 75 per cent withholding (W.H.T) tax for late tax filers.\n\nThe telecom operators do not have any system provisioning to cater for this new development as currently at large W.H.T is charged 15 per cent across all individuals irrespective of filer or non-filer. In light of recent Income Tax General Order 1 of 2024 where the government has directed to block SIMS, the first line of defence will be to charge 75 per cent W.H.T and then proceed towards blocking of sims and disconnection of their utility connections. Furthermore, it is proposed to ban travel of individuals which will be communicated by the relevant authorities.\n\nThe telecom infrastructure is not equipped to handle multiple tax rates, leading to operational inefficiencies and increased consumer costs.\n\nIn case of the Income Tax General Order, where implementing agencies do not block SIMS or mobile phones or fail to disconnect utility connections or comply with the newly introduced bar on foreign travel, a penalty of Rs100 million will be imposed upon the implementing agency for first default andRs.200 million for each subsequent default.\n\nPenalties and prosecutions are proposed for entities failing to fully disclose relevant particulars or submitting incomplete information in their tax returns or the failure to file return on discontinuation of their business. They cannot and must not be imposed to penalise compliant taxpayers who are mere instruments in enabling the Authorities to achieve its compliance targets.\n\nSuch punitive measures will only breed more litigation in the courts and ultimately compromise any objective of increasing the tax-to-GDP ratio. We recommend collaborative efforts to raise tax compliance awareness and a gradual implementation of new policies, the telecom industry added.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

Total spending was 18.87 trillion rupees ($68 billion).\n\nIn today's NA address, the opposition leader termed the federal budget against the interests of the country and nation, saying that \"investors do not invest in the countries where the rule of law is not supreme\".\n\nThe opposition leader also said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had asked the government to negotiate with all stakeholders to evolve consensus over the federal budget.\n\n\u201cThe wings of this finance minister [Muhammad Aurangzeb] have been clipped,\u201d the PTI secretary-general claimed, alleging that the government\u2019s economic figures were based on lies.\n\n\u201cThe economic survey [2023-2024] is also based on lies.\u201d\n\nHe further said that unemployment and inflation increased substantially and per capita income also declined in the country.\n\nOn Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s announcement that he would eliminate corruption from the country, Ayub laughed off the premier's statement, saying: \u201cThe pot calling the kettle black.\u201d\n\nHe said PM Shehbaz, despite being implicated in National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cases, pledged to rid the country of corruption.\n\nAyub said those involved in the \"corruption cases cannot eliminate corruption from the country\".\n\n\"Charity begins at home. Start [accountability] charity from Hudaibiya Paper Mills, London flats and Sugar mills,\" he said referring to the references filed against the Sharif family in the past.\n\n\"This government is of and for the corrupt people.

If all proposed taxes in the budget are approved then the revolution in the country would come soon,\" he claimed.",

He said in the last one year, the market had gained over 95% in rupee terms, and 100% in dollar terms.\n\nSaad Ali, Intermarket Securities Director of Research, told Geo.tv that renewed optimism for another IMF deal following a budget that was in agreement with the financial institution's recommendations and hike in base power tariff before the Eid holidays fueled the rally.\n\n\"Fitch Ratings thinks that the Budget is good enough for an IMF programme. Also, [the] market [is] taking positively PM's plan to reduce power tariff for industries,\" Ali added.\n\nThe federal government has set a challenging tax revenue target of Rs13 trillion for FY25, a near-40% jump from the current year, and a sharp drop in its fiscal deficit to 5.9% of GDP from 7.4% for the current year.\n\nPakistan had to reduce its fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6-8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nIn a statement a day earlier, Fitch Ratings said Pakistan's ambitious FY25 budget strengthens prospects for an IMF deal. \"We believe a new IMF deal will be agreed, underpinning other external funding.\"\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL) Head of Research Tahir Abbas also said that there had been no major changes in the budget for the stock market, while the budgetary framework was in line with the IMF recommendations and expectations of signing a new and bigger programme [were high].\n\nAlso, he added, a downward inflation trajectory and the likelihood of a further rate cut were keeping the market sentiment positive.\n\nSamiullah Tariq, the head of research at Pak-Kuwait Investment Company, said the market was bullish as there were expectations of major inflows from retail investors.\n\n\"In my view, market is increasing as there is anticipation of major inflow from retail investors in the market as alternate investment avenues like real estate have been heavily taxed on the budget,\" he said.",

In reaction to this, the politician said he knows who is taxing vehicles.\n\nThe committee, however, adjourned the matter in the meeting.\n\nThe politician, who is a member of the Senate in an independent capacity, objected to the tax proposals made in the budget, announced last week by the federal government.\n\nThe government has, as per analysts, devised the budget in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Islamabad hopes to sign a new and bigger programme with the global lending institution.\n\nThe federal government had to increase taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6 billion to $8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, Vawda also lamented the imposition of taxes on property in the recently proposed budget, insisting that the market across the country has become stagnant.\n\n\"Now, a common man will not be able to buy a house,\" said the senator, sharing his viewpoint during the meeting.\n\nResponding to Vawda in the meeting, the FBR chairman said tax rates in the property sector are \"fair\".\n\n\"In the property sector, tax is 15% for filers and 45% for non-filers,\" said the FBR chairman. He also highlighted that the salaried class is taxed up to 35% and non-salaried up to 45%.\n\n\"How will the common man build a house with an increased tax on property,\" said Vawda in response to the official's comment.\n\nThe FBR chairman maintained that a Re1 per kilograms increase in Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cement has been proposed by FBR, as the board has not benefitted from the increased rates of the commodity.\n\n\"Re1 is being raised so that FBR gets revenue,\" said the chairman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the FBR chairman was also questioned about the FED imposed on plots.\n\n\"How excise duty is imposed on plots?\" asked PPP senator Farooq H Naek.\n\n\"We wanted to impose sales tax,\" said the FBR chairman, who was then told by Naek that plots, in fact, neither come under the category of commodities nor services.\n\n\"Under which law did you tax the purchase of a plot? You have stretched the law and included them,\" the senator said, contesting that this law will be challenged and he doesn't favour it.\n\nThe standing committee, during the meeting, took up the matter of the FED increase on cigarettes.\n\n\"Has increasing FED on cigarettes reduced cigarette consumption?\" asked Senator Naek.\n\nResponding to the senator, the FBR chair said: \"Formal sector output has declined by 40%. But people did not stop smoking, despite increasing taxes.\"\n\nHe added that the board, this year, seized 400 million \"non-tax paid cigarette sticks\".\n\n\"If smuggled cigarettes are found in a shop, such shop will be sealed,\" he maintained.\n\nPPP Senator Sherry Rehman said: \"If you can close all the shops big and small then it is allowed.\"\n\nSenator Naek pointed out that the price of the items sold in any shop is not mentioned. He said there is no enforcement of the relevant law, terming it a violation.\n\n\"Ensure all items are priced prominently,\" said Naek, addressing FBR officials, after which the proposal was approved by the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the committee also brought amendments to the Public Finance Management Act, 2019 under consideration.\n\n\"Under the amendments, the definition of technical supplementary grant is being expanded,\" said a representative of the finance ministry.\n\nNaek asked why there was a need for the amendment, while Senator Rehman said that the Ministry of Finance is seeking the authority to use the money that cannot be used.\n\n\"The language of this law is not rightly used and should be improved first,\" said Naek, adding that the statutory amendment cannot, otherwise, be passed.\n\n\"Parliamentary approval should be sought before issuing supplementary grants,\" said committee's chairman Mandviwala.",

        "authors": [
            "Web Desk (Lahore)"
        ],
        "text": "A new album of unheard recordings by the Pakistan musical icon Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan will be released on 20 September 2024, 34 years after they were recorded. The \u2018lost album\u2019 \u2014 named Chain of Light \u2014 was discovered in the tape archives of Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World Records, the label that signed Khan in 1989 and released a series of universally acclaimed albums with him throughout the 1990s. The launch of the album is being supported in part by the British Council.\n\nJoined by his eight-strong party of singers and musicians, Chain of Light presents four traditional qawwalis (Sufi Islamic devotional songs) \u2014 including one that has never been heard before \u2014 and captures Khan at the height of his vocal capabilities in pristine sonic quality. The recording was made at Real World Studios in April 1990, during the same time he worked on Mustt Mustt, his seminal crossover album with Canadian producer Michael Brook.\n\nDescended from a 600-year-old lineage of qawwali singers, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\u2019s voice has been singularly responsible for spreading the devotional music of Sufism to the world, ever since he became the leader of his family\u2019s musical group in 1971. At turns heavy and hulkingly powerful, yet agile and pointedly precise, his vocal not only embodies the tradition of the Sufi qawwali but it is the emotive essence of singing itself.\n\nOver the course of his musical career, Khan became a cultural icon whose list of esteemed fans extended well beyond the Islamic world and into the realm of western rock and pop. The late Jeff Buckley famously said of the singer \u201cHe\u2019s my Elvis\u201d and Khan counted amongst his fans The Rolling Stones, Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. His voice also appeared on the soundtrack of movies by Hollywood directors Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone and Tim Robbins.\n\nKhan\u2019s relationship with Peter Gabriel and Real World Records began after his watershed performance at the 1985 WOMAD festival, which was the first time he performed to a predominantly western audience. Shortly after that historic festival set he was signed to the label, and his international profile rose through a collaboration on Gabriel\u2019s 1989 album Passion which featured in the movie The Last Temptation of Christ.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to work with a tonne of different musicians from all over the world in my time, but perhaps the greatest singer of them all was Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,\u201d says Peter Gabriel. \u201cWhat he could do and make you feel with his voice was quite extraordinary and we were very proud to have played a role in getting him to a much wider global audience. It was a real delight when we found out this tape had been in our library. This album really shows him at his peak. It\u2019s a wonderful record.\u201d\n\nBuried deep in a warehouse storage space at Real World Studios and unearthed whilst the label was relocating its archive in 2021, the April 1990 tape recording that comprises Chain of Light finds Khan at a crossroads, on the cusp of global greatness.\n\nIn 1997 Khan tragically died at the age of 48. He had exposed the mystical power of qawwali and its capacity for modern interpretations to the world, but his voice was no more. Almost 30 years later, the singer\u2019s legacy continues to attract new generations of fans, evident in the 6 million average monthly Spotify listeners and YouTube videos of his music racking up over 1 billion views.\n\nFans of the great maestro will be thrilled to also learn that the definitive documentary film on Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\u2019s life is in the making. Saiyna Bashir Studios, an Islamabad based company, will release their labour of love biopic Ustad at the end of 2025. The film will tell the untold story of one of the world\u2019s greatest singers, featuring rare and unseen archive footage with contributions from a cast of close family, friends, collaborators, and fans. Earlier this year, Saiyna Bashir Studios received a grant from the British Council to support Real World Records to promote Chain of Light.\n\nReflecting on the significance of this album producer Michael Brook says \u201cIt touches you, it is a once in a lifetime experience. Like the immanent light of the record\u2019s title, these songs are transformative and transcendent in a way that crosses languages and cultures. It draws the listener in, no matter their expectations. Thank God, or whatever you believe in: the voice has returned.\u201d\n\nChain of Light is out 20 September 2024 on Real World Records. CD, standard LP and limited edition LP versions of the album are available now to pre-order. Ustad, the feature-length documentary film, will premiere in late 2025.",

He pledged to oversee a national program to enroll these children back into educational institutions and expressed his hope for the provincial governments\u2019 support in achieving this goal.\n\nAs part of the collaboration, Allied, an Australian manufacturer of Google Chromebooks, will establish an assembly line in Pakistan to locally assemble Google Chromebooks, making them more affordable for educational purposes. The goal is to ensure that every student in the country has access to cutting-edge classroom technology, which will enhance their learning experience.\n\nUltimately, Google\u2019s collaboration with the Ministry of Federal Education aims to drive a large-scale digital transformation of Pakistan\u2019s education system, creating smart classrooms and fostering a healthy learning ecosystem. Both partners will work together to empower educators and students, focusing on upskilling, training, and building flexible smart classrooms.\n\nShehbaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, emphasized the need for such initiatives and said, \u201cThe work Google has been doing in the education sector is highly commendable, and we are here to support its efforts in Pakistan.\u201d He also expressed a strong interest in expanding the collaboration between Google and the Government of Pakistan and requested the Ministry of Federal Education & Professional and the Ministry of IT & Telecom to work closely to identify mutually beneficial synergies.\u201d\n\nDr. Khalid Maqbool Sidiqqui, Federal Minister of Education and Professional Training, said, \u201cThe partnership with Google for Education is a significant step forward in our efforts to provide quality education to all children in Pakistan. \u201cWe believe that technology can play a vital role in improving learning outcomes and preparing our students for the future.\u201d\n\nFarhan S.

        "text": "The Biden administration on Thursday will announce plans to bar the sale of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s antivirus software in the United States, a person familiar with the matter said, citing the firm\u2019s large US customers including critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments.\n\nThe company\u2019s close ties to the Russian government were found to pose a critical risk, the person said, adding that the software\u2019s privileged access to a computer\u2019s systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers, install malware or withhold critical updates.\n\nThe sweeping new rule, using broad powers created by the Trump administration, will be coupled with another move to add the company to a trade restriction list, according to two other people familiar with the matter, dealing a blow to the firm\u2019s reputation that could hammer its overseas sales.\n\nThe plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company\u2019s U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition, have not been previously reported.\n\nA spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to comment, while Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labeled products \u2014 that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name \u2014 will also be barred, the source said, noting that the Commerce Department will notify the companies before enforcing.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational.\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators\u2019 crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from\n\nKaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nPressure on the company\u2019s US business grew after Moscow\u2019s move against Kyiv; The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday\u2019s action.\n\nThe delayed unveiling of the prohibition is due in part to a \u201csignificant back and forth\u201d with Kaspersky, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban, the source said.\n\nHowever, the agency concluded that the threats, especially the ties to the Russian government, meant \u201cthere really were no mitigating measures that could be implemented to address those risks.\u201d\n\nUnder the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department. If someone willfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it.\n\nKaspersky, which has a U.K. holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen\u2019s retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.",
