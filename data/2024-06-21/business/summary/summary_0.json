    "summary": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained a bullish trend post-Eid holidays, driven by ongoing IMF talks and the federal budget announcement, with significant gains in commercial banks, fertilizer, and oil & gas sectors. The KSE index reached new highs, closing at 41,352 points. Concurrently, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves increased by $107 million, totaling $4.1 billion, while the US dollar saw a slight rise against the Pakistani rupee.\n\nIn Malaysia, Chinese firms signed agreements worth RM19.84 billion for investments in various sectors during Chinese Premier Li Qiang's visit. Meanwhile, Brent oil futures remained stable near seven-week highs amid geopolitical tensions in Gaza and US inventory data anticipation.\n\nIn India, the Financial Intelligence Unit imposed a fine on Binance for violating anti-money laundering regulations. The UAE continued to attract millionaires, expecting a net inflow of 4,500 high-net-worth individuals by year-end, solidifying its position as a wealth magnet.\n\nAsian stocks hovered near two-year highs, with traders awaiting US policy clues. The Bank of England held interest rates steady despite underlying inflation pressures, while Nvidia's stock surge bolstered US indexes.\n\nOverall, global markets showed mixed reactions to economic data, geopolitical developments, and central bank decisions, reflecting cautious optimism and strategic adjustments in response to evolving financial landscapes.",
