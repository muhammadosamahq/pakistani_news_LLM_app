        "text": "Bulls continued their stampede post-Eid as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed more than 2,000 points to reach an all-time high, which analysts attributed to the \u201cdovish outlook\u201d of rating agencies for the country.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index gained 1738.81, or 2.27 per cent to stand at 78,445.58 \u2014 an all-time high \u2014 from the previous close of 76,706.77 points at 1:30pm. Finally, the index closed at 78,801.53, up by 2094.76 or 2.73pc from the previous close.\n\nMohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the bullish momentum to \u201cpositive sentiments continue amid hope that new budget will help [in] securing [a] long-term IMF deal\u201d.\n\nRaza Jafri, chief executive of EFG Hermes Pakistan, said, \u201cThe market is pricing in the favourable news over the Eid holidays, including Fitch\u2019s dovish view on inflation outlook and the proposed reduction in electricity tariffs for industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bout of modest foreign selling pressure this month, possibly due to FTSE rebalancing, also appears to be largely behind us,\u201d he added.\n\nYousuf M Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, highlighted the upward trajectory was due to \u201c\u2019declining fixed income yields, no additional capital gains and dividend taxes in the budget, rationalisation of energy tariffs, improving economic sentiment and reduced uncertainty over the balance of payments situation\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, Farooq highlighted that \u201ccomments from Fitch and Moody\u2019s have all contributed to today\u2019s market rally\u201d.\n\nAwais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, echoed similar sentiments.\n\nHe said, \u201cPositive statements from global credit rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Fitch about Pakistan\u2019s budget and economic outlook bolster investor confidence in the government\u2019s strategy to address fiscal and external imbalances.\u201d\n\nShahab Farooq, director of research at Next Capital Limited, noted that the index had crossed the 78,000 level \u201camid positive comment by the two leading rating agencies\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, he attributed the climb to factors such as the \u201cstrong possibility of signing of SLA with the IMF for a new larger and longer programme, inflation expected to remain low at around 12pc for June\u201924, rethinking by the government on some tax measures announced in the budget and institutional buying\u201d.",

The new appeal system was implemented through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, which was not part of the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nThe new appeals will also follow the threshold to determine whether ATIR or CIRA will file the case, and the decisions of these bodies can be contested before the high courts by the aggrieved persons.\n\nAccording to the new amendment, the commissioner will not recover any tax for 30 days from the date of communication of the CIRA or ATIR order. The commissioner begins collecting taxes from individuals shortly after the order is issued, even if the aggrieved party still needs to receive a copy of the decision.\n\nExtends deadline to Sept 16 for transferring pending cases to ATIR\n\nThe ATIR will decide appeals within 90 days of filing, except those pending at the beginning of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, which must be resolved within 180 days. If a decision is not reached within these time frames, the minister of law and justice must issue a condonation that cannot exceed 90 days.\n\nThe ATIR has decreased the maximum term of stay granted from 180 days to 90 days; nevertheless, if the tribunal does not consider the appeal within the statutory time limit, the stay will remain in place until the decision is made.\n\nThe ATIR is required to inform the taxpayer of the opportunity to pursue the matter in the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee (ADRC), and if the taxpayer chooses to proceed with the appeal, a date for hearing and determination will be established.\n\nThe federal government has the authority to designate the chairman and members of the ATIR. Previously, such powers belonged to the prime minister. The eligibility criteria for becoming an ATIR member have been amended to erode the distinction between judicial and accountant members.\n\nOn an application based on a specific reference, the high court may issue a stay of tax collection conditional on the deposit of at least 30 per cent of the ATIR-determined amount. The stay order will expire in six months unless the reference is decided or the court withdraws it.\n\nState-owned enterprises, defined by the State-Owned Enterprises (Governance and Operations) Act 2023, must first apply to the board to create a committee to resolve disputes. If the committee does not reach a decision, an appeal can be made with the ATIR, the High Court, or the Supreme Court, as the case may be.\n\nThe ADRC provisions have been updated to include tax disputes of Rs50m or more for non-SOE taxpayers. Furthermore, ADRC decisions will be binding on taxpayers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

However, for 2024-25, the target has been set at Rs1.60tr, against the Rs1.96tr spent in the outgoing fiscal year.\n\nThe government plans to reduce the disbursement of provident funds by Rs4.64bn for the next fiscal year to Rs77.88bn.\n\nWhereas the repayments in terms of NSS will be Rs1.52tr, and the key reductions are in defence savings certificates, special saving certificates (registered), special saving accounts, regular income certificates, pensionary benefits and the Behbood Savings Certificates.\n\nAt the same time, the Shauhda Welfare Account and Sarwa Islamic Saving Accounts have seen a slight increase.\n\nAt the same time, the government has set the target of spending Rs135.71bn through various deposits and funds belonging to government departments and employees.\n\nThis includes around Rs2.15bn in the federal government employees\u2019 benevolent fund and the group insurance fund of some government departments.\n\nThe spending target for benevolent fund, group insurance and other deposits for employees of the defence ministry amounts to Rs9.89bn.\n\nThe spending related to public account expenditure through Pak PWD will be Rs55.04bn in 2024-25 and the Workers Welfare Fund allocations have been targeted at Rs25bn by the federal government.\n\nThe government has set the target to spend only Rs10.96 billion out of the Universal Service Fund (USF), which is the amount the telecom companies deposit from their earnings. This fund can only be used to develop IT and telecom infrastructure in unserved areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

The GST ratio for the textile industry has also been increased from 10pc to 18pc at different stages of value-addition.\n\nCotton Ginners Forum chairman Ihsanul Haq says there is a wave of concern in the entire cotton sector on the increase in the rates of already imposed taxes. He says that the new tax on oil cake will make it impossible for the ginners to continue their business therefore they are meeting on Sunday to frame a joint strategy to cope with the situation and it is most likely that all will agree on closing their ginning units.\n\nCriticising the government for allocating a heavy amount for the Benazir Income Support Programme in the recent federal budget, he regrets that the rulers believe in promoting \u2018beggary\u2019 instead of employment by apportioning Rs569 billion for charity and ignoring industrialisation.\n\n\u201cThe government should have better used these funds either to establish new industries or to cover up its revenue shortfall by not enhancing tax ratios on the industrial sector in the larger interest of the national economy by making operational the closed units leading to a significant increase in foreign exchange reserves through export proceeds.\u201d\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

        "text": "KARACHI: Not only Pakistanis but millionaires from the entire world are heading towards Dubai, making the United Arab Emirates the biggest wealth magnet, reported CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nThe UAE is set to lead for the third year in a row as the world\u2019s top destination for the wealthy, expecting to see a record-breaking inflow of 6,700 millionaires by year\u2019s end, according to The Henley Private Wealth Migration Report 2024 cited by CNBC.\n\nPakistani media reported last month that data prepared by the US-based non-profit Centre for Advanced Defence Studies has listed over 23,000 properties belonging to Pakistani nationals up to 2022. These were valued at $10bn two years ago but are now worth $12.5bn if not more given the 25 per cent increase in property prices in the emirate.\n\nMillionaires from Pakistan have also relocated their businesses to the UAE or migrated to other countries, but Pakistani authorities never reported officially.\n\nChina to see the biggest millionaire exodus, says report\n\nCNBC reported that the US comes in second for attracting foreign high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and is projected to see an inflow of 3,800 millionaires in 2024. However, China expects to see the biggest millionaire exodus with a projected 15,200 HNWIs anticipated to leave the country by the end of the year.\n\nA record-breaking 128,000 millionaires, or HNWIs with liquid investible wealth of $1 million or more, are expected to relocate in 2024, according to the report.\n\nThat number surpasses the previous record of 120,000 millionaires set last year, according to Henley, adding that 2024 is \u201cshaping up to be a watershed moment in the global migration of wealth\u201d.\n\nThe data for the report was supplied by global wealth intelligence firm New World Wealth and features insights on the inflows and outflows of millionaires and their migration patterns globally.\n\n\u201cThis great millionaire migration is a canary in the coal mine, signalling a profound shift in the global landscape and tectonic plates of wealth and power, with far-reaching implications for the future trajectory of the nations they leave behind or those which they make their new home,\u201d said the report.\n\nThese migration inflows into the UAE are largely boosted by movement out of the greater Middle East region, India, Russia, Africa, and more recently, the expected influx of individuals from the United Kingdom and Europe, according to the research.\n\nThe top 10 countries expecting to see the highest net inflows of millionaires in 2024, according to Henley and Partners are the UAE with 6,700; the US with 3,800; Singapore with 3,500; Canada with 3,200: Australia with 2,500: Italy with 2,200: Switzerland with 1,500: Greece 1,200: Portugal 800 and Japan 400.\n\nChina expects to see the biggest millionaire exodus with a projected 15,200 HNWIs expected to leave the country by year\u2019s end, according to the report. The UK comes in second, projected to see a net loss of 9,500 millionaires by the end of 2024, followed by India, which is expected to lose 4,300 millionaires this year.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the top 10 countries or territories projected to see the highest outflows of millionaires in 2024 are China with 15,200: the UK with 9,500: India with 4,300: South Korea with 1,200: the Russian Federation with 1,000: Brazil with 800: South Africa with 600: Taiwan (Chinese Taipei) with 400: Nigeria with 300 and Vietnam with 300.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

        "text": "GUJRAT: Amidst soaring power rates and relentless loadshedding, the demand for energy-saving inverter fans has surged across the country and most manufacturers have switched over to this technology to meet the rising demand.\n\nBut manufacturers have not discontinued making old technology fans as demand for them persists, especially in Azad Kashmir and the tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to a local manufacturer.\n\nThe federal government has proposed an investment of Rs20 billion in the budget for 2024-25 for the replacement of old technology fans with ones using low-power-consuming inverter technology. The government itself will spend Rs2bn for the purpose while the remaining amount will come in the shape of bank loans.\n\nThe facility may be given to poor families registered with the Benazir Income Support Programme to help them reduce their electricity bills as well as to bring down the nation\u2019s energy consumption.\n\nThe production of inverter fans was initiated by two manufacturing units \u2014 Khursheed Fan and Taimoor Fan \u2014 in 2013 when the country was in the grip of an energy crisis, enduring 12 to 18 hours of power outages.\n\nMoreover, when the government decided in 2014 to stop power supply to areas reporting high line losses due to power theft, the demand for inverter fans started picking up with every passing year.\n\nThe inverter fan technology is also known as brushless direct current (BLDC) motor technology. Local manufacturers have not taken up the production of motor kits at home. Instead, they rely on kits, as well as other parts, imported from China.\n\nIndigenous production\n\nIn a welcome development, some Pakistani firms have decided recently to start production of the kits at home.\n\nAlmost all manufacturing units have now switched over to the BLDC (inverter fan) technology and 80 per cent of fans being made these days run on the inverter method.\n\nInverter fans are of two types: AC (alternate current) and both AC/DC (direct current). The AC inverter fans consume 30 to 40 watts per hour while the AC/DC ones consume up to 55 watts per hour.\n\nAn old technology fan consumes 80 to 100 watts per hour.\n\nAn inverter fan usually requires 50 to 60 watts of electricity per hour to function at full speed and it can run on both the AC and DC current, according to a teacher at the University of Gujrat.\n\n\u201cThe performance of these fans has been tremendous and the industry has rapidly taken up this energy-saving technology as it brings relief to consumers fed up with inflated bills,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, however, that the price of an inverter fan is higher than fans using older technology, but that\u2019s offset by lower power consumption.\n\nThe other side\n\nBut there is a downside to the story, too.\n\nAccording to the manufacturers, switching over to the new technology has brought its own problems as now they are dependent on imported material. This has raised the cost of doing business, they complain.\n\nSome of the leading brands offer a five-year warranty on inverter fans, but most manufacturers give only a one-year warranty.\n\nThe price of a three-blade ceiling fan varies from Rs6,500 to Rs10,000. But fans using heavy motors or five blades cost as much as Rs14,000 to Rs24,000.\n\nSome units have come up with a scheme offering a discount or at least Rs2,000 on the purchase of inverter fans if a customer sells them an old fan. Initially, inverter fans made in Pakistan were slow to find an export market, but now these gadgets have made inroads in countries like Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe country currently exports fans worth $30 million annually. Fan exporters have criticised the federal government for increasing the withholding tax on exports from 1pc to 1.5pc.\n\nThey expressed fears that the move would open \u201cnew avenues of corruption\u201d, as officials from the Federal Board of Revenue would get powers to conduct audits of the export data.\n\nThey urged the government to review its decision.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

KHAN/PESHAWAR: A row between the Centre and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on loadshedding that had ostensibly settled last month resurrected on Wednesday after KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued an\u00ad\u00adother ultimatum, telling the Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) to reduce outages on all grids to 12 hours a day.\n\nPesco is among those distribution companies whose power losses are as high as 60 per cent and last month, Energy Minister Awais Leghari had explained that those feeders where losses were between 20 and 80 per cent would face 15-16 hours of outages. Against this backdrop, an agreement was reached at the end of May, with both sides agreeing to address the issue \u2018soon\u2019.\n\nHowever, as outages continued to plague KP, CM Gandapur \u2014 who is in Dera Ismail Khan for Eid holidays \u2014 visited the local grid station and directed the staff to ensure loadshedding did not exceed 12 hours a day. He issued similar directives for the rest of the province and asked the lawmakers to ensure the same. In a similar vein, a number of PTI lawmakers visited respective grid stations across the province, including the provincial capital, to forcibly end the loadshedding over the Eid holidays.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Leghari approached the interior ministry on the issue.\n\nCM tells Pesco to reduce outages to 12 hours, visits grid station to resume supply; Leghari seeks interior ministry\u2019s intervention\n\nIn a letter addressed to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the energy minister said that the KP police were not registering FIRs against those who entered the grid stations and restored the supply. He also shared a report issued by the CEO of Pesco.\n\nAccording to the report, he added, members of the KP Assembly had illegally issued orders regarding the restoration of power supply. Such incidents were being reported from Mardan, Charsadda, Tank, Bannu and Peshawar.\n\nThe energy minister urged the interior minister to ensure that all such persons be stopped from entering the grid stations who forcibly get power supply restored.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at his residence, CM Gandapur lashed out at the federal government for not honouring its commitments to the province and demanded the payment of Rs1.6 trillion owed to the province by the Centre under various heads. He said the PM contacted him for support for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) deal, adding, \u201cBut I want the province\u2019s money first; otherwise, I will tell the IMF that they [federal government] borrowed in our name and further burdens our people with taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFederal government had asked the province to give them one and half months time and cooperation in recovering electricity dues, which the KP fully complied with,\u201d he claimed, adding that now the energy minister, Awais Leghari, was not responding to his calls and text messages. It may be noted that on May 28, CM Gandapur addressed a press conference with Mr Leghari and the interior minister in which both sides \u201cclai\u00admed to have reached an agreement to end power loadshedding in the province, recover pending dues, and, address the issue of line losses\u201d.\n\nMr Gandapur asked the public not to damage Pesco assets built with the taxpayers\u2019 money; however, he added that the federal government had not kept its promise of reducing power cuts from 22 hours to 18 hours a day. \u201cI declare that there will be no loadshedding for more than 12 hours on any feeder in the province,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government had reduced the power supply to the province whereas the Pesco was \u201ccooperating\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will not remain silent on this issue, we will talk to the federal government again and demand an answer,\u201d he said.\n\nInterference in Pesco affairs\n\nAs intrusion in Pesco offices become increasingly common due to prolonged power cuts, CM Gandapur said he had told the KP police chief not to register FIRs against citizens on the Pesco\u2019s complaint.\n\nA senior Pesco official told Dawn they were facing issues of interference in many of the parts of the province, including D.I. Khan, Peshawar, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Shabqadar. The official cited instances where the police and district administration allegedly escorted mobs to the grid stations.\n\nOn the other hand, Pesco is understood to have shared a report on the situation with the federal government. Meanwhile, in-charge of D.I. Khan grid station Waseem Khan said they had forwarded the 12-hour outage schedule made by the CM to Pesco chief.\n\n\u2018Visits\u2019 to grid stations\n\nThe announcement by the KP CM prompted some visits to the grid stations but some lawmakers, like Haji Fazal Elahi, had already been doing that. Mr Elahi visited the Rehman Baba grid station and forcibly restored power supply on high-loss feeders.\n\nA Pesco spokesperson told Dawn that this action resulted into tripping of the grid, which plunged a large part of the provincial capital in prolonged darkness. \u201cRehman Baba grid supplies power to more than 20 feeders of the Peshawar and its tripping also affected other grid stations,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday and Tuesday, Mr Elahi intruded the premises of the grid station: a video on social media showed him lying on a cot inside the grid on Tuesday. Last Saturday, he entered the same power grid while heading a large protest and restored power supply on feeders undergoing scheduled outages.\n\nPesco spokesperson said the power utility would approach the police for an FIR against the MPA. Following his lead, MNA Zulfiqar Khan from Nowshera restored power supply after entering a grid station. He had also posted a video on his Facebook page.\n\nAbdul Ghani from the Bara area of Khyber barged into the grid station and restored the supply whereas MPA Shafi Jan in Kohat also visited the power station to do the same. In a Facebook post, Mr Jan said he resumed supply on feeders about which the public had complaints.\n\nIn Charsadda, minister Fazal Shakoor Khan visited the grid while MPAs Khalid Mohmand and Arshad Umerzai visited the Tangi grid after the chief minister\u2019s directions. A video posted on social media showed another provincial minister Pukhtoon Yar Khan visiting a grid station in Bannu.\n\nMeanwhile, police in Peshawar\u2019s Mathra area booked a tehsil council chairman, Mohammad Asim, and three others for entering a grid and restoring power supply. As lawmakers\u2019 intervention to restore supply continued, locals in Charsadda and Swabi protested the outages.\n\nFaiz Muhammad in Charsadda and Muq\u00adaddam Khan in Swabi also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

        "text": "THE resistance to change in Pakistan is an old problem but it wears a new face every few years. These days the resistance to change is wearing the face of an accounting problem. In other words, everything from our debt management to reforms in the power sector and tax machinery appears to us as little more than an accounting problem.\n\nThis resistance to change has been the country\u2019s key defining theme for decades now. It was laid down by Ghulam Ishaq Khan as the principal strategy with which the country would deal with the massive changes sweeping the world, starting in the 1980s and accelerating through the 1990s. GIK and a small coterie of bureaucrats around him, including but not limited to people like A.G.N. Kazi, H.U. Beg, V.A. Jafarey, Saeed Qureshi, I.A. Hanfi among others, practically ran Pakistan\u2019s economic management in those years.\n\nThey were serious men, rightly famous for their professionalism and intellect, and they operated like an exclusive club of power-wielding civil servants where admission was by invitation only. Mahbub ul Haq hovered on the outer edges of this group, a one-man army trying to champion change at a time when this coterie manned the ramparts to keep all change at bay and protect the status quo.\n\nWhat was the change they were trying to keep at arm\u2019s length? In a nutshell, it was the declining ability of the state to shoulder all the responsibilities it had picked up, first during the heady growth years of the 1960s, and then again following the disastrous nationalisations of the 1970s.\n\nFrom financing the development of the country\u2019s infrastructure to maintaining a pricing regime for agriculture and energy, to deciding who gets how much credit and on what terms, and who gets to invest how much and where, and fetch what returns on that investment, the state played an overriding role in the country\u2019s economy in those days. And this coterie of bureaucrats selected all winners and losers in the economy.\n\nDaronomics rarely works, and when it does, it racks up a tremendous bill.\n\nPakistan was not alone in facing this pressure for change in those days. It was near universal. Around the world, governments were finding their power to hold a pre-eminent position in all national economic decision-making challenged. Some responded by digging in, others by searching for a way out, and yet others by trying to externalise the costs of staying the course. It was not until the late 1980s and the early 1990s that proper reform strategies began to appear in the global conversation about breaking out of this confinement and finding new ways for economic growth to continue.\n\nCrucially, those strategies included a template for tax and power sector reforms. But they also included a more general withdrawal of the state from areas administering pricing, credit allocations, ownership of commercial enterprises and more. Taken together, these strategies came to be called \u2018the Washington Consensus\u2019.\n\nIn those days, GIK laid the foundations of how Pakistan would tackle the growing crisis of state and economy. It was his approach to first agree to wide-ranging reforms, then find ways to blunt their impact, stymie their implementation and where necessary, simply renege on commitments once the funds promised under the agreements had been released.\n\nThe first Benazir Bhutto government was overwhelmed by the scale of the challenges it had to face \u2014 the aftermath of the Afghan jihad was smouldering to the west, while to the east, an Indian arms build-up had drained Pakistan\u2019s coffers. A bankrupt economy at home and a strident IMF programme signed by the interim government prior to her taking power necessitated structural reforms so deep that governments since her time have struggled to implement them.\n\nThe first Nawaz Sharif government brought in some of the changes envisaged. They changed the debt management strategy, brought in the first non-DMG State Bank governor in the person of Muhammad Yaqub, undertook the first privatisation, liberalised trade, passed the Sales Tax Act (by a sleight of hand where they disguised it under a money bill), and opened up the capital account to free up the flow of capital into and out of the country. They also successfully wrested control of economic policy from GIK and his coterie and brought their own people into key positions, such as Sartaj Aziz and Ishaq Dar.\n\nThis is what lay at the heart of the big fight between president Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Nawaz Sharif, ending eventually with both being brought down. But what started as a fight over changing the direction of the economy, eventually became little more than a changing of the guard. The reforms of the first Nawaz Sharif government were not built to do much, other than spur short-term growth, and encourage an inflow of dollars through the foreign currency deposit scheme that became an albatross around the government\u2019s neck by the end of the decade.\n\nWhat emerged from all this is a type of economic management that today goes under the name of \u2018Daronomics\u2019, and whose principal aim is not that different from that of GIK. Daronomics aims to find ways to retain the state\u2019s pre-eminent role in the economy, while allowing enough space to private sector energies to continue the process of investment and growth. This strategy rarely works, and when it does, it racks up a tremendous bill that eventually lands up in the fiscal and public debt part of national accounts.\n\nThe challenge of our times has been to find a way to pull the state out of this role and, instead, have empowered regulators to safeguard the public interest. But the nature of the political power struggle in our country is such that all power has to flow upwards and be subservient to the requirements of this struggle. The non-stop struggle for power has paralysed the state at the top, and stymied its attempt to develop a sound reform strategy.\n\nThe writer is a business and economy journalist.\n\nkhurram.husain@gmail.com\n\nX: @khurramhusain\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2024",

        "text": "FBR Chairman Asim Ahmad says tax imposed on imported vehicles.\n\nSales tax of 25% levied on vehicles priced above Rs15mn, says Vawda.\n\nVawda also raised objections on raised tax on property sector.\n\nISLAMABAD: Senators Thursday grilled Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Asim Ahmad over the hike in taxes imposed on hybrid and electric cars, among other items.\n\nThe Senate Standing Committee on Finance, in a meeting chaired by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Salim Mandviwala, in Islamabad raised an objection on the increased tax rate on electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nDuring the meeting, independent Senator Faisal Vawda said that the use of electric vehicles is being encouraged all over the world.\n\n\"A sales tax of 25% has been levied on vehicles priced above Rs15 million,\" said Vawda.\n\nThe senator maintained that problems increase when a policy is made and revised. \"No one sets up industry in this country because of changes in taxes and policies.\"\n\nResponding to Vawda's objections, the FBR officials said that imported, not locally manufactured, vehicles have been taxed. In reaction to this, the politician said he knows who is taxing vehicles.\n\nThe committee, however, adjourned the matter in the meeting.\n\nThe politician, who is a member of the Senate in an independent capacity, objected to the tax proposals made in the budget, announced last week by the federal government.\n\nThe government has, as per analysts, devised the budget in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Islamabad hopes to sign a new and bigger programme with the global lending institution.\n\nThe federal government had to increase taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6 billion to $8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, Vawda also lamented the imposition of taxes on property in the recently proposed budget, insisting that the market across the country has become stagnant.\n\n\"Now, a common man will not be able to buy a house,\" said the senator, sharing his viewpoint during the meeting.\n\nResponding to Vawda in the meeting, the FBR chairman said tax rates in the property sector are \"fair\".\n\n\"In the property sector, tax is 15% for filers and 45% for non-filers,\" said the FBR chairman. He also highlighted that the salaried class is taxed up to 35% and non-salaried up to 45%.\n\n\"How will the common man build a house with an increased tax on property,\" said Vawda in response to the official's comment.\n\nThe FBR chairman maintained that a Re1 per kilograms increase in Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cement has been proposed by FBR, as the board has not benefitted from the increased rates of the commodity.\n\n\"Re1 is being raised so that FBR gets revenue,\" said the chairman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the FBR chairman was also questioned about the FED imposed on plots.\n\n\"How excise duty is imposed on plots?\" asked PPP senator Farooq H Naek.\n\n\"We wanted to impose sales tax,\" said the FBR chairman, who was then told by Naek that plots, in fact, neither come under the category of commodities nor services.\n\n\"Under which law did you tax the purchase of a plot? You have stretched the law and included them,\" the senator said, contesting that this law will be challenged and he doesn't favour it.\n\nThe standing committee, during the meeting, took up the matter of the FED increase on cigarettes.\n\n\"Has increasing FED on cigarettes reduced cigarette consumption?\" asked Senator Naek.\n\nResponding to the senator, the FBR chair said: \"Formal sector output has declined by 40%. But people did not stop smoking, despite increasing taxes.\"\n\nHe added that the board, this year, seized 400 million \"non-tax paid cigarette sticks\".\n\n\"If smuggled cigarettes are found in a shop, such shop will be sealed,\" he maintained.\n\nPPP Senator Sherry Rehman said: \"If you can close all the shops big and small then it is allowed.\"\n\nSenator Naek pointed out that the price of the items sold in any shop is not mentioned. He said there is no enforcement of the relevant law, terming it a violation.\n\n\"Ensure all items are priced prominently,\" said Naek, addressing FBR officials, after which the proposal was approved by the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the committee also brought amendments to the Public Finance Management Act, 2019 under consideration.\n\n\"Under the amendments, the definition of technical supplementary grant is being expanded,\" said a representative of the finance ministry.\n\nNaek asked why there was a need for the amendment, while Senator Rehman said that the Ministry of Finance is seeking the authority to use the money that cannot be used.\n\n\"The language of this law is not rightly used and should be improved first,\" said Naek, adding that the statutory amendment cannot, otherwise, be passed.\n\n\"Parliamentary approval should be sought before issuing supplementary grants,\" said committee's chairman Mandviwala.",

        "text": "Senator Faisal Vawda on Thursday claimed that most parliamentarians own smuggled vehicles.\n\nHe said this during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue today which was chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwala.\n\nThe meeting reviewed key tax proposals in the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nDiscussing the government proposal to impose a 20 percent Federal Excise Duty (FED) on juices and 18 percent General Sales Tax (GST), Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Amjad Zubair Tiwana informed the committee that these taxes were suggested by the Ministry of Industries and Production, not the FBR.\n\nSenator Vawda criticized the new budget taxes, arguing that they have negatively impacted Pakistan\u2019s property market. He further accused the International Monetary Fund of pushing for these destructive changes.\n\nChairman FBR addressed some of the panel\u2019s concerns, explaining that the salaried class is facing taxes up to 35 percent, and the non-salaried class is up to 45 percent. In the property sector, filers face a 15 percent tax rate, while non-filers will be taxed at 45 percent. Tiwana defended these rates as fair.\n\nElsewhere, the committee approved an 18 percent sales tax on nicotine pouches and duties on importing e-cigarettes.\n\nThe Senate committee also approved the government\u2019s proposal to seal shops selling non-duty-paid cigarettes. Chairman FBR said formal sector cigarette production had decreased by 40 percent, although overall smoking had not declined.\n\nSenator Salim Mandviwala expressed concerns about the IMF\u2019s understanding of the inflationary impact of such widespread taxation and questioned Chairman FBR\u2019s awareness of inflation rates resulting from increased taxes. Chairman FBR was unable to confirm this, only commenting that FBR revenues would increase as a result.\n\nThe committee also reviewed the issues facing the automobile industry. The government introduced a new auto policy for 2021-26, and private car companies briefed on a Rs. 100 million investment in hybrid and electric vehicles. However, GST exemptions on 740 items were withdrawn. Vawda seemed irked by this withdrawal of tax exemptions, terming it \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d and accused the government of sabotaging investments.\n\nVawda further alleged that such policy changes are hurting investments and that the SIFC policy is being sabotaged. He called for strict action and demanded that the Finance Minister, Industries Minister, and Chairman FBR be summoned to the next meeting to address these issues.",

        "text": "A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue was held under the chairmanship of Senator Saleem Mandviwala today to discuss various tax proposals in the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nSenator Faisal Vawda opposed increasing the tax rates on electric and hybrid vehicles, arguing that this technology was being encouraged all over the world. He lamented that unexpected policy changes were creating problems, mentioning the 25 percent sales tax on vehicles worth over Rs. 15 million. He further complained about the discrepancy in tax rates between imported and locally manufactured vehicles.\n\nVawda said if someone\u2019s shipment was due in the next six months, they didn\u2019t even know about the new policy. This means individuals expecting a delivery in six months would have to pay the new tax.\n\nThe committee postponed this matter for further discussion.\n\nIn last week\u2019s Finance Bill, the federal government proposed withdrawing tax exemptions enjoyed by electric cars valued above $50,000.\n\nImported electric vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan previously enjoyed tax benefits to promote their adoption. However, EVs valued above $50,000 have been proposed to be taxed like regular cars. This new policy will impact high-end models such as the Audi e-Tron/e-Tron GT and BMW i8. In contrast, more affordable EVs like the MG ZS EV, MG4 EV, and Rinco Aria, priced below $50,000, will likely remain unaffected.\n\nThe government has also proposed an increase in withholding tax charged on non-electric cars.\n\nOverall, this will make cars more expensive for the masses who are already struggling with record levels of inflation.",

        "text": "The government may amend Finance Bill 2024 to impose phase-wise sales tax on infant formula etc.\n\nThe phase-wise taxation under the new tax policy would be considered by the budget markers during the finalization of the recommendations under the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nFinance Bill 2024-25, recently introduced by the government, has withdrawn the zero-rating (Serial no.12(xvii) and 17 of the Fifth Schedule of the Sales Tax Act 1990) and imposed an 18 percent sales tax on locally produced infant formula, baby food, and fortified child nutrition milk powders.\n\nFinance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, in his budget speech, emphasized the importance of nutrition in the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life and reiterated the need to address stunting. However, the imposition of an 18 percent sales tax on locally produced infant formula, baby food, and child nutrition milk powders is seen by industry experts as counterproductive and contrary to the government\u2019s stated priorities.\n\nSources told ProPakistani that the FBR and Senate Standing Committee on Finance have received recommendations to introduce sales tax in three stages: starting at 5 percent in the first year, increasing to 10 percent in the second year, and finally reaching the full 18 percent in the third year.\n\nThis proposed phased approach aims to allow businesses and consumers to adjust gradually, minimizing the immediate impact on affordability and ensuring a smoother transition.\n\nThe industry has warned that the government\u2019s most recent decision of 18 percent sales tax on business and consumers across, will not just dent its long-term revenue plans, but also prove to be detrimental as businesses will shrink and eventually exit the country, withdrawing much-needed foreign investment.\n\nAmid the ongoing high inflationary climate and the inelastic buying power of consumers, industry experts have advised the government to implement a phased imposition of the General Sales Tax.\n\nIndustry representatives argue before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that the strategy would balance the need for revenue generation with the imperative to safeguard the health and well-being of infants and children.\n\nIt would also protect future investments by providing businesses with the necessary time to adapt to the new tax structure. Additionally, families would continue to provide their children with essential nutrients needed for optimal growth and development.\n\nGiven the high inflationary climate, it is essential to note that locally produced infant formula, baby food, and fortified child nutrition milk powders are priced at approximately 50 percent less than imported ones, making them more affordable for the masses. These products also drive the purchase of 300 million liters of milk from local farmers annually.\n\nExperts warn that the heavy taxation could worsen malnutrition among infants and young children, as parents may be forced to shift to unsuitable, unhealthy, and inappropriate alternative feeding solutions. Pakistan is currently facing a malnutrition crisis, among the worst in the world.\n\nThe under-five mortality rate, a key indicator of community health and nutritional status, stands at 137 per 1,000 births, which is alarmingly high by international standards. According to the National Nutrition Survey, 40% of children in Pakistan are underweight, and over half are affected by stunting.\n\nIndustry stakeholders in a recent meeting with the Senate Finance Committee urged the government and opposition Senators to recommend the phased imposition of GST to mitigate the adverse effects on child nutrition and health, ensuring a more balanced and sustainable approach to tax implementation.",

For 11MFY24, fuel costs are down 5.5 percent YoY with an average cost of Rs. 8.79/unit, compared to Rs. 9.3/unit in 11MFY23.\n\nFurnace Oil was the priciest with a cost of Rs. 31.45 per unit in May 2024 and Rs. 34.2 per unit in 11MFY24.",

On Wednesday they priced in only a 30% chance, with a first move more likely in September and a risk of a delay until November, similar to expectations for the US Federal Reserve.\n\nEither way, any cut is likely to be too late for Sunak, whose Conservative Party is around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in the pre-election polls.\n\nWhile Sunak has sought credit for the fall in inflation since he took office in October 2022, when it was at a 41-year high of 11.1%, Labour blames high mortgage rates on economic mismanagement by the Conservatives' previous leader, Liz Truss.\n\nSince the start of the election campaign the BoE has been in a self-imposed period of silence, cancelling public events.\n\nBefore that, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill had described an excessive focus on a June rate cut as \u201cill advised\u201d but both he and Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent \u2013 who steps down at the end of this month \u2013 said a rate cut over the summer was possible.\n\nThe BoE began to raise rates in December 2021, earlier than other major central banks, and they reached their current peak in August 2023.",

Norway's central bank is likely to keep its key policy interest rate unchanged.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei was 0.10% higher, while stocks in China and Hong Kong fell, weighed down by lacklustre property shares, as Beijing left its key benchmark lending rates unchanged despite recent data showing the economy remains wobbly.\n\nThe onshore yuan weakened past 7.26 per dollar for the first time since November.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the US unit against six rivals, was little changed at 105.27, while the euro was steady at $1.0746.\n\nA surge in tech stocks on Tuesday lifted AI chipmaker Nvidia above Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, leading to a global rally in tech shares.\n\nUS markets were closed on Wednesday, with tech heavy Nasdaq futures up 0.5% on Thursday.\n\nThe frenzy over artificial intelligence has resulted in technology stocks roaring through the year, with Nvidia leading the pack along with select few behemoths as US stocks clock record highs and also boost Asian counterparts.\n\n\"Nvidia remains the most important stock in the world,\" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said in a note.\n\nWeston though cautioned that index market breadth has been poor, with participation underwhelming, suggesting the rally has been built on a shaky foundation.\n\n\"The fact remains the market is now all in on the rally in AI-related names and big tech and given the lack of clear immediate risk the path of least resistance is for higher equity index levels.\"\n\nOn a macro level, investors are looking for fresh cues as to when the Federal Reserve would start its policy easing cycle after the central bank last week projected just one rate cut in the year and policymakers this week have also been cautious.\n\nThe Japanese yen languished at 158.17 per dollar as the wide difference in the interest rates between Japan and the United States weigh on the currency. The yen is down over 10% against the dollar this year.\n\n\"I think the best-case scenario is September Fed interest rate cut that narrows the yield differential between dollar and yen\", according to Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist, LGT Bank Asia.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices were mixed, with Brent steady at $85.12 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude for June was 0.23% lower at $81.38 per barrel.",

Air Link is currently trading at an FY24E PE of 8.4x and FY25F PE of 5.4x.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 7% of Lucky Cement\u2019s (LUCK) consolidated revenue comes from its mobile business, which will also benefit from the rising local demand for mobile phones. The LUCK is trading at an FY24E PE of 4.1x and FY25F PE of 3.6x,\u201d Topline added.",

The PESCO chief said that the attacks caused heavy financial loss to the company.\n\nCEO PESCO raised the concerns in a letter dated 19th June 2024, addressing the Managing Director (MD) of Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) Islamabad.\n\n\u201cIt is submitted for your information that as a general and especially during Eid Holidays, Fazle Elahi (MPA) and Arbab Aamer Ayub (MNA) along with a mob attacked 132KV Grid Station Rehman Baba, and 132KV Grid Station Kohat Road on the following events and forcefully/ unlawfully restored the supply of 11KV high loss feeders with large quantum of receivables beyond the scheduled load management hours.\n\n\u201cThe action on part of MNA and MPA caused heavy financial loss to PESCO,\u201d read the letter.\n\nThe letter added that the MPA and his team stayed for a long time in the grid stations to refrain the staff from switching off high-loss feeders.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on the same day, Zulfiqar (MNA) along with mob forcefully energized 11KV feeders at 132KV Grid Station Taru Jaba and 132KV Grid Station Pabbi repeated the same actions as narrated above besides chanting slogans and instigating the mob to strictly watch the status of feeders and harassing the staff on duty not to open the feeders otherwise threatening for dire consequences, that can be visibly watched in the videos on social media,\u201d it read.\n\n\u201cSimilar action was done by Wasim and Arshad Nazim Glozai by forcefully energizing the feeders at 132KV Grid Station Dalazak besides blockade of motorway and un-easing the general public travelling through it.\n\n\u201cBesides the above, Inam Mayor Mathra forcefully entered the 132KV Grid Station Warsak and unlawfully energized all the high-loss feeders during Eid days. He has also shifted high-loss areas on good-paying feeders illegally,\u201d read the letter.\n\nThe PESCO chief said the elected representatives along with the mob have made it a routine matter to enter the grid stations and \u201cacted unlawfully by switching on the high loss feeders\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese incidents are not only encouraging people/mob to forcefully enter the grid stations and switch on the feeders causing high financial loss to PESCO /state but also creating frightening and threatening situations for PESCO officers/officials\u2019 staff to run the system smoothly.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the switching operation of 11KV switchgear by un-trained / irrelevant people may cause blasting of equipment and all the grid stations are at high risk,\u201d it warned.\n\nPESCO said that it has requested lodging of First Information Reports (FIRs) to concerned police stations against the concerned Members of National and Provincial Assemblies.\n\nEarlier, CM Khyber Pakhtunkhwa severely criticised the federal government for the hour-long electricity load shedding in the province after protests erupted in major cities on the third day of Eidul Azha amid the heatwave.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, CM Gandapur after handing the schedule for 12-hour load shedding to the grid station officials accused Wapda officials of mistreating KP people.\n\nThe CM said, \u201cFirstly, I want the money of the province to be paid to it and if it is not paid we will inform the IMF that they are getting money in our name but not paying to us,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn a related development, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and KPK Chief Minister held a telephonic discussion on Wednesday to address the loadshedding crisis in the province.\n\nBoth leaders agreed to hold consultation and negotiations on the issue of 12 hours loadshedding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the next two days.",

Air Link is currently trading at an FY24E PE of 8.4x and FY25F PE of 5.4x.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 7% of Lucky Cement\u2019s (LUCK) consolidated revenue comes from its mobile business, which will also benefit from the rising local demand for mobile phones. The LUCK is trading at an FY24E PE of 4.1x and FY25F PE of 3.6x,\u201d Topline added.",

        "text": "LAHORE: Polyester Staple Fiber (PSF) manufacturers have drawn attention of the anomaly committee of the federal government towards the anomaly in Finance Bill 2024 related to sales tax.\n\nIn a letter to the federal government, copy available with Business Recorder, they said the Finance Bill 24 has proposed omission of S.No.21 and entries relating thereto in the 5th Schedule to the Sales Tax Act through clause 5(20).\n\nThey pointed out that S.No.21 provides zero rating to local supplies of raw-materials to registered exporters authorized under the EFS.\n\nUnder the EFS scheme, they said, all local inputs procured by the authorized exporters are entitled to zero rating under S.No.21 of 5th Schedule of the Sales Tax Act. On import, similar raw-materials are exempt from sales tax under S.No.162 of Table-I of 6th Schedule to the Sales Tax Act.\n\nAccording to the manufacturers, rule 880 of the EFS Scheme, 2021 clearly stipulates that input goods may be imported free of sales tax and local input goods liable to sales tax shall be supplied against a zero rated invoice.\n\nThey have stressed that the proposed omission of S.No.21 in the presence of S.No.162 of 6th Schedule has created a serious anomaly whereby local material is subjected to sales tax whereas the same material is exempt from sales tax on import. This anomaly would result in putting the local polyester staple fiber at clear disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis the imported fiber, they apprehended.\n\nThey have further maintained gat the exporters would prefer importing this fiber sales tax free under S.No.162 of the 6th Schedule of Sales Tax Act instead of procuring 18% sales tax laden local fiber in case this budget proposal is finally implemented as such. The exporters would also not like to procure local fiber and then undergo a cumbersome process of claiming sales tax refund thereon.\n\nIn order to ensure level playing field to the local industry as well as encouraging import substitution, the PSF manufacturers have requested to remove this clear anomaly and withdraw the proposed omission of S.No.21 in clause 5(20) of the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

The visa is aimed at \u201cproviding long-term residence to foreign investors, entrepreneurs, and talented individuals including specialists, students, and researchers who make a significant investment to the country,\u201d according to Henley & Partners.\n\nThese migration inflows into the UAE are largely boosted by movement out of the greater Middle East region, India, Russia, Africa, and more recently, the expected influx of individuals from the United Kingdom and Europe, according to the research.\n\nSingapore ranked third, with a projected net inflow of 3,500 millionaires in 2024. The island-nation also leads as the top destination for high-net-worth individuals looking to relocate to Asia.\n\nJapan also made it into the top 10, boosted in part by the trend of an inflow of Chinese HNWIs post-Covid, according to the report.\n\nHere are the 10 countries or territories projected to see the highest outflows of millionaires in 2024:\n\nChina: -15,200\n\nUnited Kingdom: -9,500\n\nIndia: -4,300\n\nSouth Korea: -1,200\n\nRussian Federation: -1,000\n\nBrazil: -800\n\nSouth Africa: -600\n\nTaiwan (Chinese Taipei): -400\n\nNigeria: -300\n\nVietnam: -300\n\nChina expects to see the biggest millionaire exodus with a projected 15,200 HNWIs expected to leave the country by year end, according to the report. The UK comes in second, projected to see a net loss of 9,500 millionaires by the end of 2024, followed by India, which is expected to lose 4,300 millionaires this year.\n\nThe UK, previously one of the top destinations for the wealthy globally, has recently seen a big outflow of millionaires.\n\n\u201cThe outflow already generated by the economic and political turmoil in Britain risks being accelerated by further unwelcome policy decisions ahead of the election,\u201d said Dr. Hannah White, director and CEO of the independent think tank the Institute for Government.\n\nMillionaires are also leaving China and India in droves.\n\n\u201cBoth China and India are seeing high net outflows because of the success of their [sizable] economies in generating new millionaires, although slowing wealth growth in China in recent years could mean sustained losses become more damaging over time,\u201d said White.\n\n\u201cIndian millionaires often depart the sub-continent in search of a better lifestyle, safer and cleaner environments, and access to more premium health and education services,\u201d she added.",

        "text": "Britain\u2019s central bank looks on course to hold interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25% on Thursday as underlying inflation pressures prove persistent, depriving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of a much-needed boost ahead of a July 4 election.\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey opened the door early last month to a rate cut, saying he was \u201coptimistic that things are moving in the right direction\u201d and that a June rate cut was an option \u2013 although no fait accompli.\n\nBut despite data on Wednesday showing headline inflation fell back to the BoE\u2019s 2% target for the first time in nearly three years in May \u2013 reaching its goal quicker than in the United States or eurozone \u2013 the medium-term picture is now less reassuring.\n\nServices price inflation has fallen less than the BoE expected at the time of the last meeting \u2013 only declining to 5.7% rather than 5.3% \u2013 and private-sector wage growth is almost twice the rate the BoE judges as compatible with 2% inflation.\n\nLast month the central bank forecast inflation would rise to around 2.6% by the end of the year, as the effect of recent cuts to regulated household energy bills faded.\n\nNone of the 65 economists in a Reuters poll last week said they expected the BoE to follow the lead of the European Central Bank and cut rates this month, with the next statement on August 1 looking by far the most probable start date for an easing cycle.\n\nInstead, the expectation is for a repeat of May\u2019s 7-2 vote split, when Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and external Monetary Policy Committee member Swati Dhingra voted for a quarter-point cut.\n\n\u201cWe think the Bank of England is left waiting for more reassuring data \u2026 either in the shape of a more decisive moderation in services CPI or with all other broader signals \u2026 pointing in a softer direction,\u201d Victoria Clarke, chief UK economist at Santander, said.\n\nWhile unemployment is at a two-and-a-half year high of 4.4%, economic growth this year has been reasonable by Britain\u2019s recent weak standards.\n\nFinancial markets are doubtful about an August rate cut. On Wednesday they priced in only a 30% chance, with a first move more likely in September and a risk of a delay until November, similar to expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nEither way, any cut is likely to be too late for Sunak, whose Conservative Party is around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in the pre-election polls.\n\nWhile Sunak has sought credit for the fall in inflation since he took office in October 2022, when it was at a 41-year high of 11.1%, Labour blames high mortgage rates on economic mismanagement by the Conservatives\u2019 previous leader, Liz Truss.\n\nSince the start of the election campaign, the BoE has been in a self-imposed period of silence, cancelling public events.\n\nBefore that, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill had described an excessive focus on a June rate cut as \u201cill-advised\u201d but both he and Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent \u2013 who steps down at the end of this month \u2013 said a rate cut over the summer was possible.\n\nThe BoE began to raise rates in December 2021, earlier than other major central banks, and they reached their current peak in August 2023.",

This measure aims to expedite the resolution of tax disputes.\n\nTax disputes pending before the Commissioner Inland Revenue-Appeal (CIRA) involving over Rs20 million in income tax or refunds, over Rs10 million in sales tax, and over Rs5 million in federal excise duty will be moved to the newly established ATIR. The CIRA will handle cases below these thresholds.\n\nThis new appeal system was introduced through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, separate from the Finance Bill 2024.\n\nNew appeals will follow the same thresholds to determine whether they go to ATIR or CIRA. Decisions from these bodies can be contested in high courts.\n\nAccording to the new amendment, the commissioner will not recover any tax for 30 days from the communication of a CIRA or ATIR order. This change addresses the issue of tax collection starting before the aggrieved party receives a copy of the decision.\n\nThe ATIR is required to decide appeals within 90 days of filing, except for those pending at the start of the Tax Laws (Amendment) Act 2024, which must be resolved within 180 days. If a decision is not reached within these time frames, the minister of law and justice must issue a condonation not exceeding 90 days.\n\nThe ATIR has reduced the maximum stay term from 180 days to 90 days. However, if the tribunal does not consider the appeal within the statutory time limit, the stay will remain in place until a decision is made.\n\nThe federal government now has the authority to designate the chairman and members of the ATIR, a power previously held by the prime minister. The eligibility criteria for ATIR members have been amended to remove the distinction between judicial and accountant members.\n\nThe high court can issue a stay of tax collection based on a specific reference, conditional on the deposit of at least 30% of the ATIR-determined amount. This stay order will expire in six months unless resolved or withdrawn by the court.\n\nState-owned enterprises must first apply to the board to form a committee to resolve disputes before appealing to the ATIR, High Court, or Supreme Court. For non-SOE taxpayers, ADRC provisions now include tax disputes of Rs50 million or more, with decisions binding on taxpayers.",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Asim Ahmad Thursday was questioned by senators over the increased taxes on the country's automobile, property, and other sectors.\n\nLawmakers, who are members of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, grilled the FBR chairman during a meeting chaired by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Salim Mandviwala in Islamabad.\n\nIndependent Senator Faisal Vawda said that the use of electric vehicles is being encouraged all over the world.\n\n\"A sales tax of 25% has been levied on vehicles priced above Rs15 million,\" said Vawda.\n\nThe senator maintained that problems increase when a policy is made and revised. \"No one sets up industry in this country because of changes in taxes and policies.\"\n\nResponding to Vawda's objections, the FBR officials said that imported, not locally manufactured, vehicles have been taxed. In reaction to this, the politician said he knows who is taxing vehicles.\n\nThe committee, however, adjourned the matter in the meeting.\n\nThe politician, who is a member of the Senate in an independent capacity, objected to the tax proposals made in the budget, announced last week by the federal government.\n\nThe government has, as per analysts, devised the budget in line with the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as Islamabad hopes to sign a new and bigger programme with the global lending institution.\n\nThe federal government had to increase taxes and reduce the fiscal deficit as part of negotiations with the IMF, with which it is discussing a loan of $6 billion to $8 billion, as it seeks to avert a debt default for an economy growing at the slowest pace in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, Vawda also lamented the imposition of taxes on property in the recently proposed budget, insisting that the market across the country has become stagnant.\n\n\"Now, a common man will not be able to buy a house,\" said the senator, sharing his viewpoint during the meeting.\n\nResponding to Vawda in the meeting, the FBR chairman said tax rates in the property sector are \"fair\".\n\n\"In the property sector, tax is 15% for filers and 45% for non-filers,\" said the FBR chairman. He also highlighted that the salaried class is taxed up to 35% and non-salaried up to 45%.\n\n\"How will the common man build a house with an increased tax on property,\" said Vawda in response to the official's comment.\n\nThe FBR chairman maintained that a Re1 per kilograms increase in Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cement has been proposed by FBR, as the board has not benefitted from the increased rates of the commodity.\n\n\"Re1 is being raised so that FBR gets revenue,\" said the chairman.\n\nDuring the meeting, the FBR chairman was also questioned about the FED imposed on plots.\n\n\"How excise duty is imposed on plots?\" asked PPP senator Farooq H Naek.\n\n\"We wanted to impose sales tax,\" said the FBR chairman, who was then told by Naek that plots, in fact, neither come under the category of commodities nor services.\n\n\"Under which law did you tax the purchase of a plot? You have stretched the law and included them,\" the senator said, contesting that this law will be challenged and he doesn't favour it.\n\nThe standing committee, during the meeting, took up the matter of the FED increase on cigarettes.\n\n\"Has increasing FED on cigarettes reduced cigarette consumption?\" asked Senator Naek.\n\nResponding to the senator, the FBR chair said: \"Formal sector output has declined by 40%. But people did not stop smoking, despite increasing taxes.\"\n\nHe added that the board, this year, seized 400 million \"non-tax paid cigarette sticks\".\n\n\"If smuggled cigarettes are found in a shop, such shop will be sealed,\" he maintained.\n\nPPP Senator Sherry Rehman said: \"If you can close all the shops big and small then it is allowed.\"\n\nSenator Naek pointed out that the price of the items sold in any shop is not mentioned. He said there is no enforcement of the relevant law, terming it a violation.\n\n\"Ensure all items are priced prominently,\" said Naek, addressing FBR officials, after which the proposal was approved by the Standing Committee on Finance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the committee also brought amendments to the Public Finance Management Act, 2019 under consideration.\n\n\"Under the amendments, the definition of technical supplementary grant is being expanded,\" said a representative of the finance ministry.\n\nNaek asked why there was a need for the amendment, while Senator Rehman said that the Ministry of Finance is seeking the authority to use the money that cannot be used.\n\n\"The language of this law is not rightly used and should be improved first,\" said Naek, adding that the statutory amendment cannot, otherwise, be passed.\n\n\"Parliamentary approval should be sought before issuing supplementary grants,\" said committee's chairman Mandviwala.",
