    "summary": "India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) fined Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, for operating in India without registration and violating anti-money laundering regulations. Binance did not immediately respond to the allegations. Additionally, the FIU issued show-cause notices to nine other offshore exchanges and requested the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to block access to these exchanges. KuCoin, another crypto exchange, registered with the FIU in March and faced a smaller penalty. In a related international context, Canada's anti-money laundering agency also fined Binance in May for similar violations, and Binance's former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, was sentenced to four months in prison in the U.S. for money laundering violations.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Islamabad Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) extended the deadline to September for transferring pending tax cases to the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) to expedite the resolution of tax disputes. The FBR also faced scrutiny from senators over increased taxes on vehicles and properties, with debates focusing on the impact on the common man and the automotive industry. The FBR defended the tax rates as fair, while discussions also covered the broader implications of tax policies influenced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",
